Michael Jackson wore tape on his nose to get front pages , former body@@ guard claims
Michael Jackson &apos;s former body@@ guard has claimed the late singer cultivated some of his ec@@ centr@@ ic@@ ities with the deliberate intention of r@@ iling up the media .
Matt F@@ id@@ des , now a property developer and owner of a martial arts / dance chain , told Metro that Jackson believed the fasc@@ ination around his person@@ a would stop if he ceased to be a &quot; mystery &quot; in the public eye .
To get front pages , he would reportedly don surgical masks and put tape on his nose to spark conversation .
We &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s true . You can form your own view .
&quot; He knew how to manipulate the media . He knew exactly how to get the front page , &quot; F@@ id@@ des , who was Jackson &apos;s body@@ guard for 10 years , said . &quot; 90 per cent of the time it worked , by putting a mask on his face , or stic@@ ky tape on his hands - or tape on his nose was a favourite one . He would say he wanted his life to be the greatest mystery on Earth . &quot;
He added : &quot; It &apos;s back@@ fired on him now , though , that &apos;s the sad thing . &quot;
F@@ id@@ des also addressed allegations of child sexual abuse against Jackson by W@@ ade Rob@@ son and James Saf@@ ech@@ uck , which were aired in the controversial , Em@@ my A@@ war@@ d-@@ winning documentary Le@@ aving Ne@@ ver@@ land .
Both Rob@@ son and Saf@@ ech@@ uck alle@@ ge that they were abused by Jackson as children for a number of years .
F@@ id@@ des claimed that &quot; this whole pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile thing is complete nonsense ... the guy had girl@@ friends and had a legitimate marriage to Lisa Marie &#91; Pres@@ ley &#93; , that was the way he lived his life . &quot;
He claimed it would have been &quot; impossible &quot; for Jackson to have abused children at his Ne@@ ver@@ land ran@@ ch because he was &quot; hardly &quot; there .
&quot; They say there were boys around , that was not the case at all , &quot; he said .
The Jackson estate has denied all allegations against the late star . Jackson denied all claims against him until his death in 2009 .
Government Reti@@ res 15 More Senior Tax Officials On G@@ raft Char@@ ges
New Delhi :
The government has compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 more tax officers in the fourth tran@@ che of its crack@@ down on err@@ ant officials accused of corruption and other mal@@ practices .
The Central Board of In@@ direct Ta@@ xes and Customs ( CB@@ IC ) -- the agency that oversees G@@ ST and import tax collections -- compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 senior officers under Fundamental Rule 56 ( J ) on corruption and other charges , official sources said .
Since June , this is the fourth round of s@@ acking of corrupt tax officials . In the previous three rounds , 49 high ranking tax officers , including 12 from the Central Board of Direct Ta@@ xes ( CB@@ D@@ T ) , were compul@@ sor@@ ily retired .
Sources said the action was in line with Prime Minister N@@ aren@@ dra Mo@@ di &apos;s address to the nation from the ram@@ parts of the Red Fort when he had said some black sheep in the tax administration may have mis@@ used their powers and harassed taxpayers , either by targeting honest assesses or taking excessive action for minor or procedural violations .
&quot; We have recently taken the bold step of compul@@ sor@@ ily retiring a significant number of tax officials , and we will not tolerate this type of behaviour , &quot; he had said .
Nearly half of the officials retired were those who were arrested by the CB@@ I for allegedly receiving illegal grati@@ fication . One of them was caught accepting a bribe of Rs 15,000 . One official is accused of having assets disproportionate to his known source of income .
In June , the government had compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 commission@@ er-@@ level officials of CB@@ IC on charges of corruption , collecting and giving bribes , smuggling and even criminal conspiracy . Prior to that , the government had compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 12 senior IR@@ S officials from the Income Tax department over charges of corruption , sexual harassment , disproportionate assets under Rule 56 ( J ) of the Central Civil Services ( Pension ) Rules .
In August , the government compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 22 CB@@ IC officials . The Rule 56 ( J ) of Central Civil Services ( Pension ) Rules , 1972 provides for periodical review of the performance of government servants with a view to ascertain whether they should be retained in service or retired in public interest .
As per these instructions , the cases of government servants covered by F@@ R 56 ( J ) , 56 ( 1 ) or Rule 48 ( 1 ) ( b ) of CC@@ S ( Pension ) Rules , 1972 should be reviewed six months before they attain the age of 50-@@ 55 years , in cases covered by F@@ R 56 ( j ) and on completion of 30 years of qualifying service under F@@ R 56 ( 1 ) or Rule 48 of CC@@ S ( Pension ) Rules , 1972 .
A woman in Maine got 500 letters from United He@@ alth@@ care within five days
Steph@@ anie L@@ ay said she found the piles of letters from the insurance company st@@ ashed in her mail@@ box between Thursday and Monday .
&quot; A week ago Thursday was the first wave of letters , I got 46 letters , &quot; she told CNN . &quot; I immediately called United He@@ alth@@ care insurance and told them I received 46 letters of the same letter . &quot;
And the letters just kept coming , piling up to more than 500 by Monday .
They were addressed to her son , who has au@@ tism and lives in a private care facility , she said . But instead of her son &apos;s name inside when you opened them , the letters said Dear Maine &apos;s Department of Health and Human Services -- in C@@ incin@@ nat@@ i , she told local media .
The letters were about a $ 54 or $ 0 healthcare claim that United He@@ alth@@ care said is not covered , L@@ ay said .
When she asked United He@@ alth@@ care why she was receiving a mountain of letters , she was told it was a coding issue , she said .
In a statement , United He@@ alth@@ care told CNN it &apos;s working to resolve the issue but it cannot provide details due to privacy requirements .
&quot; We have determined the cause of the problem . We are very sorry this occurred , and we have contacted the family to discuss the situation with them , &quot; the health insu@@ rer said .
L@@ ay said the letters all have a message at the bottom urging people to go paper@@ less . &quot; I &apos;m thinking they had to take down half of a forest just to send this , &quot; she said .
Antonio Brown says he &apos;s not quite ready for retirement
Antonio Brown has indicated he &apos;s not retiring from the NF@@ L , only a few days after announcing he was done with the league in a Twitter rant .
The four@@ -time All-@@ Pro wide receiver wrote on Twitter on Thursday : &quot; I &apos;m still the best why stop now . &quot; He followed with the suggestion that the game needs him .
Brown has been accused of sexual misconduct by two women . He was released by the New England Patri@@ ots last week after playing only one game . He &apos;s been dumped by three teams in the last six months .
Brown , who lost Ni@@ ke as a sponsor last week , says he &apos;ll practice at high schools one day a week , starting in Miami .
The 31-@@ year-old Brown also engaged in a Twitter sp@@ at with Los Angeles R@@ ams safety Eric Wed@@ dle , who faced him often with the Baltimore Ra@@ vens .
H@@ SBC f@@ lips cri@@ me-@@ spo@@ tting tool to scope new business
British bank H@@ SBC ( H@@ SB@@ A.@@ L ) has converted a financial cri@@ me-@@ spo@@ tting algorithm it was forced to build in the wake of a money-laundering scandal into one that can scope out new business opportunities , bank executives said .
The system combines data on clients &quot; banking activities , with public data on company ownership and direc@@ tor@@ ships , to flag desirable potential clients to H@@ SBC staff and offer ways to connect to them through existing relationships .
Using data and artificial intelligence to try and boost revenues is part of H@@ SBC &apos;s broader push to squeeze more out of its large physical network and client data , a key priority for interim Chief Executive No@@ el Qu@@ inn .
&quot; It &apos;s one of the first commercial uses of investment in financial crime prevention , and the business we &apos;re getting in this way is inherently lower risk and quicker to win , &quot; said Stu@@ art Ni@@ vis@@ on , H@@ SBC &apos;s global head of client network banking .
H@@ SBC declined to comment on how much it expects to make from the new system but said the broader &quot; network income &quot; initiative has already yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue .
The drive is an important part of the bank &apos;s efforts to defend its global presence at a time when some analysts and investors are saying it should shrink or exit markets like the United States where it makes returns below its cost of capital .
H@@ SBC was forced to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in financial crime compliance as part of a $ 1.9 billion settlement in 2012 with U.S. authorities over the bank &apos;s failure to prevent money laundering by drug cartels though its Mexican unit .
The system works by mapping individual customers &quot; and companies ties to each other and then looking for unusual patterns of transactions or un@@ ear@@ thing previously unknown connections between those entities .
That system has already freed up more than 400 staff to go from manually checking transactions and records to cli@@ ent-@@ facing roles where they can spend time helping customers , said Ad@@ rian R@@ ig@@ by , chief operating officer of H@@ SBC &apos;s trade business .
H@@ SBC &apos;s Ni@@ vis@@ on said the light@@ bulb moment was realizing the tool could be re@@ purpos@@ ed to look for &quot; green flags &quot; of attractive potential clients rather than &quot; red flags &quot; of wrongdoing .
&quot; We took our customer dat@@ as@@ et and combined it with ( Britain &apos;s ) Companies House data and turned the algorithm around to look for attr@@ activeness in a client , whether that be through sector , growth of the company , and connection to existing clients , &quot; Ni@@ vis@@ on said .
The tool has mapped 2@@ 2.5 million entities and people in Britain , and can identify in three minutes a network of connections that a staff member would have taken three hours to map out manually , he said .
Iran was promised that &apos; all &apos; US sanctions would be lifted in return for talks , Rou@@ han@@ i claims
European nations were so eager to negotiate with Iran that they suggested the US would end its sanctions regime if Tehran was willing to engage in dialogue , President Hassan Rou@@ han@@ i has said .
According to Rou@@ han@@ i , European signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump , promising that Washington would lift &quot; all &quot; sanctions in return .
&quot; Three out of the six countries , that is the chan@@ cellor of Germany , prime minister of Britain , and president of France , all insisted for the meeting to be held , saying that the US would lift all sanctions , &quot; stated the Iranian president .
He said he rejected the proposal because , &quot; under sanctions and maximum pressure , &quot; it would have been impossible to predict the end result of any negotiations .
Trump quickly denied that he had offered Iran any relief , t@@ wee@@ ting that Tehran had asked him to lift sanctions as a prerequisite to talks , but that he had &quot; of course &quot; refused .
In his statement , Rou@@ han@@ i also said that numerous countries were on Iran &apos;s side during their one-@@ on-@@ one talks on the sidel@@ ines of the UN@@ GA . &quot; We discussed various issues with various countries , and all of them condemned the United States &quot; withdrawal from the J@@ CP@@ O@@ A and its pressures . This is a huge success for Iran . &quot;
Dog control laws to be reviewed in government consultation
Dog control laws in Scotland are being reviewed amid concerns about out-of-@@ control animals and irresponsible owners .
A consultation has been launched by the Scottish Government seeking the public &apos;s views .
Scotland &apos;s Community Safety Minister pledged to &quot; keep communities safe from irresponsible owners , &quot; with reviews to determine whether laws for out-of-@@ control dogs need changing .
As@@ h Den@@ ham MSP said : &quot; We are holding two reviews into dog control legislation because we are absolutely determined to help keep communities safe from irresponsible owners and their out-of-@@ control dogs .
&quot; This consultation seeks views on improvements on how the Control of Do@@ gs Act 2010 can operate across Scotland , and next year we will take a wider look at all dog control legislation to assess whether changes are needed .
&quot; Ow@@ ning a dog brings with it certain responsibilities , including keeping your dog under effective control , and I encourage everyone with an interest in this area to respond to our consultation . &quot;
The consultation runs until January 15 and contains proposals to tough@@ en and clarify the current legislation , including questioning whether a national dog control database should be created .
The Scottish Parliament &apos;s Post-@@ Legislative S@@ cru@@ tiny Committee has been hearing evidence from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs , prompting the Government to review dog control laws .
M@@ SPs were told the legislation needs urgent reform to protect vulnerable people and children .
The committee heard that , in Greater Glasgow and C@@ ly@@ de alone , there were 1,4@@ 17 people arriving at A &amp; E departments with dog@@ -related injuries , 255 of them children , last year .
N@@ HS Lan@@ ar@@ kshire treated 9@@ 12 people and N@@ HS Ay@@ r@@ shire 4@@ 39 , both four-year high@@ s .
In July , the committee &apos;s M@@ SPs concluded current dog control legislation is not fit for purpose and called on the Scottish Government to undertake a comprehensive review of all do@@ g-@@ control laws .
Conven@@ er Jenny Mar@@ ra said : &quot; Dog law in Scotland is not fit for purpose . There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks .
&quot; It has become clear that current dog control law doesn &apos;t work . It needs reform urgently so that out of control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly and we can try to move to a system that prevents our children being injured by dogs . &quot;
The consultation , launched on the Government &apos;s website on Friday , says : &quot; Effective and consistent enforcement across Scotland is fundamental in helping address issues relating to out-of-@@ control dogs .
&quot; This review is focused on steps that can be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities , as they use their powers to help keep communities safe . &quot;
Saudi Arabia To Off@@ er Tourist Vis@@ as For First Time , Abol@@ ish Ab@@ aya Rule
Vis@@ as in Saudi are currently restricted to exp@@ at workers , their depen@@ dents and Muslim pilgri@@ ms .
Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time , opening up the ultra-@@ conservative kingdom to holid@@ ay@@ makers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil .
K@@ ick@@ starting tourism is one of the cent@@ re@@ pieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman &apos;s Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-@@ oil era .
The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia &apos;s oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which ro@@ iled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict .
&quot; Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country , &quot; tourism chief Ahmed al-@@ Kh@@ ate@@ eb said in a statement .
&quot; Visitors will be surprised ... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites , a vibrant local culture and brea@@ th@@ taking natural beauty . &quot;
Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday , Blo@@ om@@ berg News quoted Kh@@ ate@@ eb as saying .
Kh@@ ate@@ eb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women , allowing them to go without the bod@@ y-@@ sh@@ ro@@ uding ab@@ aya ro@@ be that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women .
Foreign women , however , will be required to wear &quot; modest clothing , &quot; he added , without elaborating .
Vis@@ as in the desert kingdom , endowed with rich be@@ dou@@ in heritage and archaeological sites , are currently restricted to exp@@ at workers , their depen@@ dents and Muslim pilgri@@ ms travelling to holy sites in Mec@@ ca and Med@@ ina .
In a rare move , Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kick@@ start tourism .
But the au@@ st@@ ere kingdom , which for@@ bids alcohol and has a strict social code , is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists .
Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liber@@ alisation drive that has brought new cinem@@ as , mix@@ ed-@@ gender concerts and sporting extravag@@ anz@@ as to Saudi Arabia .
International criticism of the kingdom &apos;s human rights record , including the gru@@ esome murder last year of critic Jam@@ al Kh@@ as@@ ho@@ gg@@ i and a crack@@ down on female activists , could further put off foreign visitors , observers say .
F@@ ears of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Ara@@ m@@ co may also dam@@ pen the kingdom &apos;s appeal to holid@@ ay@@ makers .
The government , re@@ eling from low oil prices , says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030 , compared to three percent currently .
It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists .
But the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to ac@@ com@@ o@@ date visitors in such high numbers , with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade .
The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs , the government says , as it battles high youth unemployment .
Saudi Arabia has spl@@ urged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch .
In 2017 , the kingdom announced a multi-@@ billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pris@@ tine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resor@@ ts .
Last year , construction of Q@@ id@@ di@@ ya &quot; entertainment city &quot; was launched near Riyadh , which would include high-@@ end theme parks , motor sport facilities and a saf@@ ari area .
The country is also developing historic sites such as the centu@@ ri@@ es-@@ old M@@ ada &apos;@@ in Sal@@ eh , home to sand@@ stone tom@@ bs of the same civil@@ isation which built the Jordanian city of Pe@@ tra .
Facebook hi@@ des &apos; likes &apos; in new Australia trial
Facebook has begun hiding the number of &quot; likes &quot; for posts in Australia , it said today , a trial designed to ease social pressure that could be rolled out worldwide .
Account holders across the country will also be blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people &apos;s posts from today , but will still be able to see how people respond to their own .
&quot; We don &apos;t want Facebook to feel like a competition , &quot; the company said in a statement .
&quot; This is a test to see how people engage with this new format . We hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly , &quot; it said .
More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide , but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform &apos;s impact on mental health .
In Australia , one in five children report experiencing cyber@@ bullying , according to the country &apos;s e@@ Safety commissioner .
Facebook &apos;s decision comes after it launched a trial in July to hide &quot; likes &quot; on the company &apos;s other major social media platform , In@@ stag@@ ram .
What began as a test on In@@ stag@@ ram in Canada was expanded to Australia , Brazil and several other major markets .
The Facebook trial was described as &quot; a limited test in order for us to get some early lear@@ nings . &quot;
&quot; While this has been testing on In@@ stag@@ ram , Facebook and ( In@@ stag@@ ram ) are different surfaces and we will likely see different data come from this test , &quot; the company said .
The social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for .
&quot; We want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience , while also not limiting any positive interactions , &quot; said M@@ ia Gar@@ lick , of Facebook Australia .
Loren@@ zo strengthens into Category 4 hurricane east of Caribbean
Hurricane Loren@@ zo strengthened into a Category 4 storm Thursday , producing s@@ wells that could affect parts of the Wind@@ ward Islands and South America , the National Hurricane Center said .
The eye of the major hurricane was about 1,6@@ 60 miles southwest of the A@@ zo@@ res in the N@@ HC &apos;s 11 p.m. ED@@ T update . The storm was moving north-@@ northwest at 14 mph with 145 mph maximum sustained winds .
The storm isn &apos;t forecast to make landfall in the coming days , though a turn toward the northeast Saturday could bring Loren@@ zo near the A@@ zo@@ res in the middle of next week . Forec@@ asters predict the storm will weaken below Category 3 on Monday .
S@@ wells generated by the storm could cause life-@@ threatening sur@@ f and ri@@ p currents in the Wind@@ ward Islands and northeastern South America .
Loren@@ zo is the season &apos;s second Category 4 or higher storm . Dor@@ ian reached Category 5 status near the Bahamas .
According to Colorado State University Meteor@@ ologist Philip K@@ lot@@ z@@ bach , the Western Hem@@ isphere , which encompasses the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins , has generated 16 named storms since Aug@@ . 21 .
&quot; This is the most on record for the Western Hem@@ isphere between Aug@@ . 21-@@ S@@ ept . 23 , breaking the old record of 15 named storms set in 1984 and 2002 , &quot; he wrote on Twitter .
Patri@@ ot missile system to Saudi Arabia after Iran oil attacks
U.S. Soldiers talk after a routine inspection of a Patri@@ ot missile battery at a Turkish military base in Gaz@@ i@@ an@@ te@@ p , Turkey .
The Pent@@ agon on Thursday announced that the U.S. will send a Patri@@ ot missile battery , rad@@ ars and roughly 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the attacks on its oil facilities earlier this month .
Defense Secretary Mark Es@@ per has &quot; approved putting additional forces on prepare to deploy orders , &quot; Pent@@ agon spokesman Jonathan Ho@@ ff@@ man wrote in a statement . &quot; While no decision has been made to deploy these additional forces , they will maintain a heightened state of readiness . &quot;
Those additional forces include two Patri@@ ot missile artillery batteries and one Terminal High Al@@ titude Area Defense , or TH@@ A@@ AD missile defense system .
TH@@ A@@ AD , one of the world &apos;s most advanced missile systems , can target incoming missiles and blast them out of the sky . TH@@ A@@ AD intercep@@ tors , fired from a tr@@ uck@@ -based launcher , use kinetic energy to deliver &quot; hit to kill &quot; strikes to ballistic threats .
&quot; It is important to note these steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners , and the security and stability in the Middle East . Other countries have called out Iranian mis@@ ad@@ ventures in the region , and we look for them to reinforce Saudi Arabia &apos;s defense , &quot; Ho@@ ff@@ man wrote .
President Donald Trump s@@ lam@@ med Iran &apos;s alleged role in the attacks on Saudi oil facilities , telling world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that they should pressure Tehran into diplomatic talks .
&quot; All nations have a duty to act , &quot; Trump said regarding his call to counter Iranian behavior . &quot; No responsible government should subsidi@@ ze Iran &apos;s blood@@ l@@ ust . As long as Iran &apos;s men@@ acing behavior continues , sanctions will not be lifted , they will be tightened . &quot;
The S@@ ept . 14 strikes on the world &apos;s largest cru@@ de-@@ processing plant and oil field forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations . The dr@@ one attacks triggered the largest spi@@ ke in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a bud@@ ding conflict in the Middle East . While Tehran has been widely blamed for the attacks , it maintains that it was not involved .
Sky@@ di@@ ver dies after cra@@ shing into big ri@@ g trailer on California highway
The 28-@@ year-old woman was sky@@ diving with a group of seven people around 2 p.m. Thursday , California Highway Pat@@ rol P@@ IO Ru@@ ben Jones told CNN .
The group took off from the Lo@@ di Par@@ ach@@ ute Center . CNN has reached out to the facility for comment .

&apos;@@ H@@ ide@@ ous &apos; Central Coast cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age child rap@@ ist ordered to look at victim in court
D@@ ressed in a leaf@@ y G@@ hil@@ lie cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age suit , the man grabbed the then 12-@@ year-old from behind and dragged her into bus@@ h@@ land as she made her way to school on the state &apos;s Central Coast in May 2017 .
He then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her .
Shortly after the arrest , a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation .
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the gro@@ oming and sexual abuse of another girl , aged 11 , between August 2016 and April 2017 .
The 12-@@ year-old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bushes armed with a large tree branch and a knife .
An example of a cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age G@@ hil@@ lie suit the man used .
When she pleaded &quot; stop , stop , stop , &quot; he put her in a head@@ lock and forced her into the scru@@ b .
The man told the girl : &quot; Sh@@ h@@ h , don &apos;t scre@@ am . Don &apos;t scre@@ am or I &apos;ll have to hurt you . &quot;
Holding the knife in his right hand , he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before l@@ ashing her to the tree and ab@@ using her for almost an hour . After he cut her loose , the girl ran crying hy@@ ster@@ ically to school .
The man arrived at work about 9.@@ 30@@ am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues .
With dirt , grass and tree matter on his clothes , he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had ch@@ ased another driver into the bush and fallen down an emb@@ ank@@ ment .
The man &apos;s sentencing hearing continues on Tuesday .
No federal charges in fatal California police shooting
Federal authorities declined to pursue civil rights charges Thursday against Sac@@ ra@@ mento police officers who fat@@ ally shot an unarmed black man , a killing that sparked protests and spurred changes to a state law governing when authorities can use deadly force .
The U.S. Attorney &apos;s Office and the FBI said a federal review of the 2018 shooting of 22-@@ year-old Steph@@ on Clark found &quot; insufficient evidence &quot; to pursue charges against Officers Ter@@ rance Merc@@ ad@@ al and J@@ ared Rob@@ in@@ et . Both will be returned to active duty .
The California attorney general &apos;s office in March declined to issue state criminal charges after a nearly year@@ long investigation . Attorney General X@@ avier Bec@@ erra said then evidence showed the officers had reason to believe their lives were in danger because he was advancing toward them holding what they thought was a gun . Investig@@ ators found only a cell@@ phone .
Sac@@ ra@@ mento police also announced Thursday their internal investigation did not find any policy or training violations .
&quot; Although no policy violations occurred in this incident or in the events leading up to it , we are committed to implementing strategies that may prevent similar tragedies in the future , &quot; Sac@@ ra@@ mento Police Chief Daniel Ha@@ hn said in a statement .
Clark &apos;s brother , Ste@@ van@@ te Clark , posted on Facebook Thursday that he was in a meeting with federal and local authorities . &quot; These people have failed when it comes to ( accountability ) , &quot; he wrote .
Authorities have said the officers believed Clark was approaching them with a gun after he ran from them into his grandparents &quot; back@@ yard . The officers had been pursuing Clark after receiving calls about someone breaking car windows and an elderly neighbor &apos;s sliding glass door .
The officers shot Clark seven times as he approached them .
The federal investigation looked at evidence such as witness statements , audio and video recordings , dispatch records , police reports , and autop@@ sy reports to determine whether the officers acted will@@ fully with the intent to use objectively unreasonable force .
Law@@ makers last month updated the nation &apos;s oldest law governing police use of deadly force , making it now among the country &apos;s most comprehensive when combined with additional training .
California &apos;s old standard made it rare for police officers to be charged following a shooting and ra@@ rer still for them to be convicted . It was based on the doctrine of &quot; reasonable fear , &quot; meaning if prosecutors or jur@@ ors believed officers had a reason to fear for their safety , they could use lethal force .
The new law , which takes effect Jan@@ . 1 , will allow police to use deadly force only when &quot; necessary &quot; to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious injury to officers or by@@ stand@@ ers .
Pope warns tech ex@@ ec@@ s to use AI for the common good
Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives , diplomats and financi@@ ers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good .
Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers , physici@@ sts and eth@@ ic@@ ists . A s@@ mat@@ tering of academics and Catholic bish@@ ops rounded out participants at &quot; The Common Good in the Digital Age &quot; conference .
The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and per@@ ils of artificial intelligence .
The debates included technology advan@@ cements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines , as well as a case study examining the Christ@@ church , New Zealand , massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the car@@ n@@ age .
In his speech to the conference , Francis praised the potential of technological progress , noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monot@@ onous labor . But he warned that increased reliance on robo@@ tics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor .
&quot; If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities , it would not be true and real progress , &quot; he warned . &quot; If mankind &apos;s so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good , this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbar@@ ism dictated by the law of the strongest . &quot;
Organiz@@ ers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants &quot; expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues .
The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall .
The Democ@@ rati@@ c-@@ held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump &apos;s action by a 23@@ 6-@@ 174 margin , sending it to the president . Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it . The Senate already approved the measure in a 5@@ 4-@@ 41 vote , as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it .
Trump will likely veto the resolution , the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president . He already ve@@ to@@ ed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March .
Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to over@@ ride the president &apos;s opposition .
F@@ ailing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress , Trump declared the national emergency in February . His administration plans to pull $ 3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects .
Democrats have accused Trump of both circum@@ ven@@ ting Congress &apos; power of the purse and ra@@ iding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers . A handful of Republicans in both the House and Senate also had concerns about the precedent Trump &apos;s declaration would set for executive over@@ reach in the future .
Some Senate Republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote .

September 27 is , however , not Google &apos;s actual birthday .
If you take the company &apos;s incorporation date as its birthday , then Google was born on September 4 , 1998 , however , the company never celebrated the day as its birthday , at least not in the form of a d@@ oo@@ dle . Google celebrated September 7 as its birthday in d@@ ood@@ les until 2005 , following which it switched to September 27 .
Initially , the search engine was called &quot; Back@@ Ru@@ b &quot; and it was later renamed &quot; Google . &quot;
&quot; We chose our systems name , Google , because it is a common spelling of goo@@ gol , or 10@@ 100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines , &quot; Serge@@ y Br@@ in and Lawrence ( Larry ) Page wrote in 1998 in a paper published about launching a prototype of a &quot; large-scale search engine . &quot;
The company got its start thanks to Sun co-@@ founder Andy Bec@@ h@@ tol@@ sh@@ ei@@ m who invested $ 100,000 ; in June 1999 , the company had raised a $ 25 million round from S@@ equ@@ o@@ ia Capital and Kle@@ iner Per@@ kins . Google moved to its Mountain View location in the same year , where it remains . In 2001 , the company was granted a patent for its technology .
What started out as a Web search engine has since turned into a massive con@@ glomer@@ ate that calls itself Al@@ p@@ ha@@ bet and Google is a subsidiary company . Today , Google operates all over the world in over 100 languages , answering tril@@ lions of search queries each year .
&quot; The relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we do , &quot; Google writes on its Our Story page . &quot; Today , with more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries , Google makes hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe , from YouTube and Android to Smar@@ t@@ box and , of course , Google Search . Although we &apos;ve dit@@ ched the Leg@@ o servers and added just a few more company dogs , our passion for building technology for everyone has stayed with us - from the dor@@ m room , to the garage , and to this very day .
Oil falls after Iran claims US offered to remove sanctions , Trump denies
Iranian President Hassan Rou@@ han@@ i makes a speech during a ceremony in Tehran , Iran on January 10 , 2019 .
Oil sli@@ d after Iranian President Hassan Rou@@ han@@ i claimed Friday that the U.S. offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for negotiations . President Donald Trump and the State Department later denied those claims , causing oil to rebound from the lows .
W@@ T@@ I crude futures were last down by 0.9 % to $ 5@@ 5.@@ 91 after falling as low as $ 5@@ 4.@@ 79 . B@@ rent crude futures dropped 1.4 % to $ 6@@ 1.@@ 89 .
&quot; The German chan@@ cellor , the prime minister of England ( Britain ) and the president of France were in New York and all insisted that this meeting take place . And America says that it will lift the sanctions , &quot; Rou@@ han@@ i said on his official website , according to Reuters . &quot; It was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they ( the United States ) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions . &quot;
Trump later said he responded &quot; of course , NO ! &quot; to Iran who he said wanted him to lift the sanctions in order to meet .
The State Department called the report &quot; bas@@ eless , &quot; adding the U.S. is committed to zero oil exports from the Iranian regime , Blo@@ om@@ berg News said .
Rou@@ han@@ i &apos;s comment came after a series of d@@ ron@@ es attacked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia on S@@ ept . 14 , which had forced the kingdom to cut production in half . The U.S. and some European countries , as well as Saudi Arabia , have blamed the attack on Iran . Tehran has denied any role in the incident . The Trump administration also announced plans to deploy U.S. forces to the region .
The State Department didn &apos;t immediately respond to CN@@ BC &apos;s request for comment .
&quot; There &apos;s been a big bear@@ ish risk from a th@@ aw in the US Iran situation for some time and this will put a remarkable amount of oil back onto the market immediately if it were to occur , &quot; said John Kil@@ du@@ ff of Again Capital .
&quot; It &apos;s not just Iranian production and exports . Its &apos; millions of barrels in floating storage and millions of barrels sitting in China &apos;s ports waiting to be processed by customs , &quot; Kil@@ du@@ ff said .
Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal between Iran , the U.S. and five other countries that removed sanctions from the country in return for its commitment to end its nuclear .
The Islamic Republic , a target of U.S. sanctions for decades , was blamed by Washington for recent attacks on oil tan@@ kers in the Strait of Hor@@ mu@@ z , which Tehran denies . Iran also shot down a U.S. military dr@@ one and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. sp@@ ies .
Afghanistan boo@@ sts security for presidential election
A massive security operation is in place across Afghanistan for the country &apos;s presidential election on Saturday .
About 100,000 security personnel are to guard polling stations in the wake of Taliban threats .
The fear of reprisals means many voters - particularly in rural areas - will stay at home , while others say the voting system favours the powerful , not the poor .
Royal news : How Princess Beat@@ rice &quot; reacted with fur@@ y at hostile family members &quot;
On Thursday , The Duke and Du@@ chess of York announced that their eldest daughter , Princess Beat@@ rice , is engaged to her boyfriend , the 3@@ 4-@@ year old property ty@@ co@@ on E@@ do@@ ardo Map@@ elli Mo@@ zz@@ i . The Princess , who is nin@@ th-@@ in-@@ line to the throne , will tie the knot with Mr Map@@ elli Mo@@ zz@@ i next year . The couple said in a statement : &quot; We are both so excited to be embar@@ king on this life adventure together .
&quot; We share so many similar interests and values , and we know that this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead , full of love and happiness . &quot;
Princess Beat@@ rice &apos;s parents , Prince Andrew and Sarah Fer@@ gus@@ on , also shared their excitement .
The Du@@ chess of York wrote on Twitter : &quot; I know what a mother feels so I have tears of joy . I am so proud of this sen@@ s@@ ational news .
&quot; Andrew and I are just the l@@ uc@@ ki@@ est people ever to have two great sons in law . &quot;
The royal wedding will be another occasion for the entire Royal Family to get together , and hopefully completely repair Fer@@ gie &apos;s relationship with the Duke of Edinburgh .
Since Sarah was embro@@ iled in one of the Royal Family &apos;s biggest ever scand@@ als , her relationship with the rest of the members has been extremely difficult .
Five months after announcing she was separating from Prince Andrew in 1992 , compromising photographs of her with her &quot; financial advisor &quot; were taken at her holiday vill@@ a in St Tro@@ pe@@ z .
The sn@@ aps appeared to show Tex@@ an million@@ aire John Br@@ yan kis@@ sing and suc@@ king the Du@@ chess &quot; toes and the arch of her foot , and Prince Philip in particular , is said to have had the strongest reaction to her daugh@@ ter-@@ in-law &apos;s scand@@ al@@ ous an@@ tics .
However , his behaviour was reportedly &quot; appalling &quot; towards the Du@@ chess of York , and Princess Beat@@ rice once claimed her mother was the victim of &quot; mean spir@@ ited actions to make her feel un@@ welcome . &quot;
J@@ US@@ T IN : Kate and William behind closed doors : Cou@@ ple &apos;s shock habit exposed
The report noted that the Du@@ chess &quot; spokesman was unable to comment on the claims , but a friend of Fer@@ gie was quoted as saying : &quot; It is no secret that Sarah &apos;s daughters are pretty fed up by the way their mother has been treated by some members of the Royal Family .
&quot; Some of the bills she has been sent have been pretty mis@@ erly .
&quot; They are constantly ber@@ ating their father for allowing it to happen and Beat@@ rice in particular has been impl@@ oring Prince Andrew to see that their mother is not treated as an out@@ cast . &quot;
Philip and Sarah were pic@@ tured for the first time together in 26 years at Princess Eu@@ gen@@ ie &apos;s wedding to Jack Brook@@ s@@ bank last October .
The Next Big Labor Stri@@ ke H@@ its Oregon
The state university workers &quot; most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work . The pay disparities alone are shocking . About half of these workers earn less than $ 40,000 per year ( and hundreds make less than $ 25,000 ) . Meanwhile , university presidents &quot; annual salaries average out to $ 500,000 and four university athle@@ tics coaches are pulling down a cool $ 1 million . While school administrators enjoy six-@@ figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to blo@@ at , one in six classified staff@@ ers qualify for food stamps .
As Ale@@ jan@@ dro Seg@@ ur@@ ra , another IT worker at Portland State University , said , &quot; I &apos;m willing to go on strike because I don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair that people are paid wages that don &apos;t allow them to live in the city that they serve . &quot; Portland State library worker The@@ resa Sta@@ ple@@ burg was even more direct : &quot; I want to strike because I &apos;ve been here 24 years , and I need a raise - a living wage . &quot;
As inflation clim@@ bs and the cost of living in Oregon so@@ ars , these workers are being left to fl@@ ounder , and management has shown little sympathy for their plight . Contract negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-@@ August . At that point , the bosses had laid out some particularly eg@@ regi@@ ous proposals - a pal@@ try cost-@@ of-@@ living increase , a denial of seniority demands from long-term university workers , and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as dis@@ respectful , and even cruel . &quot; There is an un@@ written class system at the universities , &quot; Ful@@ mer said . &quot; And we are at the bottom of it . &quot;
&quot; Education workers have been under attack for decades , &quot; he continued . &quot; We are finally standing up and fighting back . It &apos;s one thing to see classi@@ sm and the sque@@ ez@@ ing of the middle class in the corporate world as executives see their relatively ob@@ scene pay continue to go up at rates above inflation . But for the same thing to be happening in education is not something workers will continue to tolerate . &quot;
And Oregon &apos;s state university workers aren &apos;t the only ones taking action . Oregon is a powder ke@@ g of milit@@ ancy right now , and its fuse is now burning bright and hot . Gro@@ cery store workers at the Fred Me@@ yer supermarket chain are ramp@@ ing up their campaign against their employer , and while there are no official plans to strike yet , tensions are running high ; their union , United Food and Commercial Workers Local 5@@ 55 , has already called for a boycott , and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain .
In the healthcare sector , the 4,500 members of the Service Employees International Union Local 49 workers at Ka@@ iser Per@@ man@@ ente authorized a strike ( with a 98 percent approval rate ) if a deal isn &apos;t reached before their existing contract expires in October - which was only narrowly avoided with a new tentative agreement . El@@ sewhere in the industry , the Oregon Nur@@ ses Association , which represents more than 120 nurses at A@@ stor@@ ia Hospital , has been dead@@ locked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration ; their last contract expired in May , and the clock is tic@@ king .
&quot; Oregon has a really strong labor movement that is really building from the ground up , &quot; Bur@@ ley explains . &quot; This is a part of the national wave of labor growth . People are seeing a precarious economy where real wages are falling and the solution is collective action in the workplace . &quot;
It &apos;s unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall , but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the Northwest in 2019 . And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further , into the heart of Mid@@ western farming , Southern manufacturing , Tex@@ an oil fields , Ap@@ pal@@ achi@@ an coal mines , Nor@@ theastern construction , the Silicon Valley tech giants , and everywhere in between . Lord knows that something &apos;s gotta give .
Ci@@ v@@ ility in Politics : New awards scheme set up to counter Westminster division and recognise politicians who show courtesy
A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work .
It comes after a divi@@ sive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament .
It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Bor@@ is Johnson .
To counter the division , the &quot; Ci@@ v@@ ility in Politics &quot; awards were announced on Friday , with the politician of the year to be awarded £ 3,000 to give to charity .
Bor@@ is Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber
Lord Stewart , announcing the awards , said : &quot; Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of ci@@ v@@ ility .
&quot; As divisions and bitter@@ ness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit , we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mir@@ ror@@ ing these trends , but by buc@@ king them .
&quot; These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persu@@ a@@ sions - to shine a spot@@ light on politicians who argue their case with dec@@ ency and ci@@ v@@ ility , and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all . &quot;
Nomin@@ ations will open on Saturday , with an award ceremony in March next year .
In an exclusive interview with the Standard , former Cabinet minister Am@@ ber Rud@@ d today accused Mr Johnson of deploying aggressive language that &quot; does incite violence . &quot;
Mr Johnson , for his part , said he &quot; deplo@@ res &quot; threats made against MPs .
J@@ ess Phil@@ lips &apos; frightened &apos; after receiving &apos; be afraid &apos; death threats
On Thursday , Labour MP J@@ ess Phil@@ lips - another one of those to have criticised Mr Johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to &quot; kick the door &quot; of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a &quot; fasc@@ ist . &quot;
Liberal Democrat leader J@@ o S@@ win@@ son , meanwhile , was speaking to police following threats made to one of her young children .
And in a viral Twitter thread , El@@ lie Cooper , the daughter of senior Labour MP Y@@ vet@@ te Cooper , described her fears for her mother in the wake of Ms Co@@ x &apos;s murder . She accused Mr Johnson of &quot; using language that helps incite violence toward MPs . &quot;
Setting the example ? Income inequality in the US is at an all-@@ time high
Last year the income gap between richest and poorest people in the US stood at its highest level since 1967 , the first year the Census Bureau started tracking it . DC and New York are among places where the differences are worst .
The US may be the world &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est nation , but it is also one where the super-@@ rich thrive no matter what while the desperately poor often rely on Go@@ F@@ und@@ Me to pay their medical bills . The economic inequality affects both wealth and incomes , with the latter being at an all-@@ time high .
One way to measure income inequality is the G@@ ini index . It measures between 0 , a score for absolute equality and 1 , which stands for a hypothetical situation in which a single household gets all income in a nation . The Census Bureau has been tracking the index for over 50 years . In 1967 it stood at 0.@@ 3@@ 97 but , in 2018 , it rose to 0.@@ 4@@ 85 , the highest figure on the record .
There are nations with worse income inequalities , including some with reasonably strong economies . For example , the World Bank estimates that South Africa &apos;s G@@ ini index stood at 0.@@ 63 in 2014 while Brazil &apos;s was 0.@@ 53 in 2017 . By comparison , all EU countries have a G@@ ini index below 0.4 .
The new data shows that income inequality is most acute in places where wealth is concentrated , including DC , New York and Connecticut , as well as in poverty-@@ ridden areas like Puerto Rico and Louisiana . Utah , Alaska , Iowa , North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality .
The census also showed a stag@@ n@@ ating growth of median household income , which grew to over $ 6@@ 2,000 . It &apos;s the highest level ever measured by the American Community Survey , but the increase was just 0.8 from 2017 to 2018 , much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years and amounting to virtually no growth at all if adjusted to inflation .
The new statistics will likely put some wind into the s@@ ails of progressive Democratic conten@@ ders for the party nomination for next year &apos;s presidential election , who call for leaning on the super-@@ wealthy individuals and on big corporations to pay more taxes .
It may also undermine the rationale behind the current administration &apos;s corporate tax breaks , which were passed through Congress in 2017 . The goal was to convince mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als to bring back manufacturing jobs as money trick@@ les down to the middle and poor classes . In practice , it seems , it led to extra bonuses for executives and the rest of the country largely missing out on the benefits a growing economy and record low unemployment . Well , someone needs to pay for all those private jet trips .
North Carolina man wins five times in the same lottery drawing
A North Carolina man won five times in the same lottery drawing , including a $ 16@@ 3,6@@ 34 j@@ ack@@ pot .
Add Lan@@ c@@ aster of Pi@@ ke@@ ville told North Carolina Education Lot@@ tery officials he used five sets of his own numbers to buy a Cash 5 ticket with five plays for Monday night &apos;s drawing when he stopped at W@@ iss@@ am &amp; Brothers Inc. in Pi@@ ke@@ ville .
&quot; My wife writes down the numbers for me during the drawing , &quot; Lan@@ c@@ aster said . &quot; When she handed me the paper , so I could check my ticket , I couldn &apos;t believe it . One of my lines matched five numbers and the other ones matched four numbers . I started shouting , &apos; I got it ! I got it ! I hit the lottery ! &apos; &quot;
Lan@@ c@@ aster &apos;s line that matched all five numbers earned him the $ 16@@ 3,6@@ 34 j@@ ack@@ pot , while the lines that matched four numbers each won $ 250 .
The winner said he plans to use the money to pay his bills and make some home repairs .
Kh@@ lo@@ e K@@ ard@@ as@@ hi@@ an &apos;s cheating ex Tri@@ stan Thompson leaves AN@@ OTHER desperate comment on her In@@ stag@@ ram p@@ ic after rum@@ ours he wants her back
K@@ H@@ LO@@ E K@@ ard@@ as@@ hi@@ an &apos;s cheating ex Tri@@ stan Thompson has left AN@@ OTHER desperate comment on her In@@ stag@@ ram page following rum@@ ours that he wants her back .
The 35-@@ year-old star dumped the NBA player for good earlier this year after he was accused of cheating on her with family friend Jord@@ yn Woods - having previously che@@ ated when she was nine months pregnant with their daughter , True .
Tri@@ stan was spotted leaving another g@@ ushing compliment on Kh@@ lo@@ e &apos;s In@@ stag@@ ram page
However , 28-@@ year-old Tri@@ stan is refusing to give up without a fight - leaving a cr@@ in@@ ge@@ worthy compliment on his ex &apos;s latest sel@@ fi@@ e .
In the bl@@ urred snap , Kh@@ lo@@ e is stood in front of the rising sun , with the m@@ um-@@ of-@@ one cap@@ tioning the p@@ ic : &quot; May you have the courage to explore every dream you dream . &quot;
Publ@@ ic@@ ly commenting , Tri@@ stan wrote : &quot; The sun is shining bright on a beautiful &#91; diamond emo@@ ji &#93; . &quot;
F@@ ans were outra@@ ged by the remark , with one replying : &quot; Yeah , a diamond that you D@@ RO@@ PP@@ ED . &quot;
Tri@@ stan che@@ ated on Kh@@ lo@@ e when she was nine months pregnant
Another advised : &quot; Just get off In@@ stag@@ ram . &quot;
A third wrote : &quot; Don &apos;t fall for it Kh@@ lo@@ e . &quot;
It comes just days after Tri@@ stan wrote : &quot; Perfec@@ tion &quot; alongside the heart eye emo@@ j@@ is underneath one of the reality stars other photos , which saw her modelling for Gu@@ ess Je@@ ans .
Earlier this month , The Sun revealed that Tri@@ stan bought Kh@@ lo@@ e a £ 400,000 Por@@ sche in a bid to win her back - on the advice of Dra@@ ke .
He was then accused of cheating again earlier this year - with K@@ ard@@ as@@ hi@@ an family friend Jord@@ yn Woods
He settled on the gro@@ vel@@ ling gift , thought to be a 9@@ 11 , after being urged to pull a &quot; power move &quot; by his rap@@ per p@@ al .
As a result , p@@ als said Tri@@ stan even won an invite from Kh@@ lo@@ e to a &apos; T@@ aco Tuesday &apos; dinner at her man@@ sion - bringing him one step closer to a re@@ union with the reality star and their 17-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old daughter True .
A source said : &quot; Tri@@ stan is good p@@ als with Dra@@ ke and has been using him as a sounding board as he plots his return to the K@@ ard@@ as@@ hi@@ an fold .
Kh@@ lo@@ e was left heart@@ broken by Tri@@ stan &apos;s inf@@ id@@ elity
&quot; Dra@@ ke told him to pull out all the stops if he wanted to win Kh@@ lo@@ e back .
&quot; An invite to a casual dinner might not sound like a reasonable trade off for a sle@@ ek super@@ car .
&quot; But after what Tri@@ stan did , he can &apos;t expect Kh@@ lo@@ e to roll out the red carpet for him . &quot;

Ste@@ m cells of 56 child cancer patients lost at Children &apos;s Hospital after freez@@ er mal@@ function
A freez@@ er mal@@ function at Children &apos;s Hospital Los Angeles resulted in the loss of 56 children &apos;s blood stem cells that were harvested at the beginning of each patient &apos;s on@@ c@@ ology therapy and stored in the event they could prove useful in the future .
&quot; We apologize for any distress or confusion that this has caused our patients and their families , &quot; the hospital wrote in a statement . &quot; If you have not received a letter or phone call from our team , your child is not impacted . &quot;
All but one patient had gone through initial therapy . That patient did require the recol@@ lection of stem cells , chief medical officer James Ste@@ in said .
A letter sent to families earlier in September informing them of the loss was accidentally addressed to the children - rather than the parents . The hospital has also apolog@@ ized to parents for the messaging oversight .
The hospital said that the loss of stem cells , which had been placed in long-term storage , has not jeopardized any child &apos;s health . The hospital has also offered to assist families who want to harvest again . But the process can be gru@@ eling .
One of the patients described it as &quot; painful . &quot; Se@@ an Anderson Cor@@ ona , 13 , underwent stem cell therapy when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuro@@ bl@@ ast@@ oma - a cancer often found in the ad@@ renal g@@ lands . The boy was hoo@@ ked up to machines for a day@@ long process that collects the stem cells from the blood . The blood is then re@@ inf@@ used back into the body .
&quot; I would try to sleep and my body would just start shaking , and then I just started to f@@ reak out and I &apos;d start crying , &quot; Cor@@ ona told AB@@ C-@@ 7 .
Cor@@ ona will be can@@ cer@@ -free for three years in November . But his mother , Elizabeth Anderson , said that she worries that if his cancer does return , it may be impossible to harvest more stem cells from his blood .
Ste@@ in said that the recol@@ lection of patients &quot; stem cells would only be recommended in the event that they are needed in the event that the patient relap@@ ses .
&quot; We think that &apos;s going to be incredibly unlikely so we wouldn &apos;t ask anyone to do that in advance , &quot; he said .
The freez@@ er has since been replaced , and the sen@@ sor@@ -@@ monitoring and alert system have been upgraded .
&quot; Obviously , this is a huge deal for us . &quot; Ste@@ in said . &quot; We &apos;re reaching out directly to every single family in person to make sure that all their questions are answered . &quot;
Prince Harry walks across Angolan mine@@ field to re@@ connect with Prin@@ ces Diana &apos;s legacy
It &apos;s day six of the Duke of Sus@@ sex &apos; royal tour of Africa with his wife Me@@ gh@@ an and baby Arch@@ ie . But Friday morning , Harry returned to Angola alone to re@@ connect with the legacy of his late mother , Princess Diana .
Diana &apos;s legacy was brought full circle when Harry don@@ ned the distinctive blue body armor of the H@@ AL@@ O Trust . Twenty-@@ two years ago , Diana took a similar path across an Angolan field scattered with deadly landmines , left over from years of civil war . It became one of the most ic@@ onic images of her short life .
W@@ earing protective body armor and a vis@@ or , Diana , Princess of Wales , visits a mine@@ field being cleared by the charity Hal@@ o in Hu@@ am@@ bo , Angola , January 15 , 1997 .
She was campaigning to rid the world of this weapon of war , but never lived to see her success , dying just months before an international treaty banned landmines in December 1997 .
Over two decades later , the world is still not free of these devices . And echo@@ ing his mother , loud and clear , Prince Harry detonated a recently detected mine .
&quot; Land@@ mines are an un@@ heal@@ ed scar of war , &quot; Prince Harry said . &quot; By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace , and with peace comes opportunity . &quot;

Thomas Cook pension truste@@ es plot deal to salv@@ age pay@@ outs
Thomas Cook &apos;s pension funds have kicked off talks with specialist insurers about a deal to salv@@ age the collapsed travel group &apos;s retirement scheme benefits .
Sky News has learnt that Steve Southern , chair of the truste@@ es , is holding talks with several parties about a bu@@ y@@ out deal that would avoid most of Thomas Cook &apos;s 14,000 pension scheme members facing a steep cut to their payments .
Any deal with an insu@@ rer would be likely to involve a more modest cut to pay@@ outs than the 10 % triggered by a pension scheme &apos;s transfer into the Pension Protection Fund ( PP@@ F ) life@@ boat .
The discussions are at a very preliminary stage and - even if successful - will not result in a deal until after the Thomas Cook schemes have been through an assessment by the PP@@ F .
Thomas Cook bosses face investigation into what led to collapse
That period could take up to two years , and if the schemes do enter the PP@@ F will result in roughly 10,000 future pensioners having their pay@@ outs cut by 10 % .
Sources said that a number of pension risk transfer specialists , as well as at least one of the new &quot; super@@ fund &quot; consolidation vehicles , were in talks with Thomas Cook &apos;s truste@@ es about a deal .
News of the truste@@ es &apos; efforts to secure members &apos; benefits comes four days after Britain &apos;s oldest tour operator ceased trading , spar@@ king an international repatriation programme and triggering thousands of job losses .
Thomas Cook &apos;s descent into insolvency has sparked a bitter blame game , with board members , government ministers and auditors all facing demands to explain their actions in the months before its collapse .
The company &apos;s four pension schemes are well-@@ funded , with a £ 100@@ m surplus on a PP@@ F basis , according to the latest figures .
Collec@@ tively , they hold assets worth about £ 1.@@ 5@@ bn .
However , as Sky News revealed last month , the truste@@ es &apos; demands for better terms in Thomas Cook &apos;s proposed rescue deal added a further complication to efforts to get the transaction across the line .
Thomas Cook &apos;s liquidation brought to an end 178 years of solvent trading , prompting the launch of inquiries by the government &apos;s Insolvency Service , the accounting watch@@ dog and an influential committee of MPs .
Ministers have established a tas@@ k@@ force to address the crisis , which has left creditors facing me@@ ag@@ re returns from the post-@@ insolvency sale of assets .
To date , just under half of Thomas Cook &apos;s overseas British customers have been flown home .
Its collapse came hours after Thomas Cook issued a la@@ st-@@ gas@@ p plea to its lenders to reduce a £ 200@@ m funding demand .
What went so wrong for Thomas Cook ?
The talks , which concluded without a deal on Sunday evening , represented a fran@@ tic last throw of the dice for a company which had been forced to seek more than £ 1@@ bn in new funding following a £ 1.@@ 5@@ bn half-@@ year loss and deteriorating trading .
Thomas Cook was founded in 18@@ 41 by a 32-@@ year-old c@@ abin@@ et-@@ maker and former Baptist pre@@ acher who began offering one-day rail ex@@ cur@@ sions from Le@@ ic@@ ester to Lou@@ gh@@ borough for a sh@@ illing .
From there , it went on to become one of the world &apos;s largest holiday companies , marking its 17@@ 5th anniversary three years ago .
A PP@@ F spokesperson said : &quot; Insolvency events , like the liquidation of Thomas Cook , are exactly why the PP@@ F was set up .
&quot; We are here to protect the financial futures of members belonging to defined benefit pension schemes and they should take comfort knowing we are here to protect them . &quot;
A spokesman for Thomas Cook &apos;s pension truste@@ es declined to comment on Friday .
Ad@@ orable pictures show new-@@ born r@@ hin@@ o nu@@ zz@@ ling her mother and exploring new home
Baby St@@ ella was welcomed into the world at Cot@@ sw@@ old Wildlife Park , Ox@@ for@@ d@@ shire , earlier this month and is the first female born to parents Mon@@ ty and Ru@@ by .
The young@@ ster , who is healthy and nursing well , can be seen wondering about her enclosure before resting alongside her mother on a bed of straw .
Mother Ru@@ by joined the wildlife park in 2009 alongside another female called Nancy in the hope that one would produce the park &apos;s first ever cal@@ f with Mon@@ ty .
Nancy then gave birth to a female named A@@ stri@@ d in 2013 , with St@@ ella being the third female cal@@ f born at the park in its 4@@ 9-@@ year history .
Jam@@ ie Cra@@ ig , cur@@ ator of Cot@@ sw@@ old Wildlife Park , said : &apos; We have had tremendous success with our current r@@ hin@@ o herd .
&apos;@@ St@@ ella is the sixth young@@ ster from Nancy and Ru@@ by and our bull , Mon@@ ty , has proved to be an excellent dad .
&apos;@@ He is the perfect combination of a dominant bull and caring patri@@ arch .
&apos;It is particularly satisfying that Ru@@ by has produced a female cal@@ f - these are vital for the development of the breeding programme and St@@ ella will eventually move to another collection to hopefully become a successful mother herself . &apos;

When Alan was just one-@@ week old he weighed around eleven stone .
Bir@@ ths in captivity are considered extremely rare . Fem@@ ales only reproduce every two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half to five years , so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited .
According to the park , a typical ge@@ station period lasts between sixteen to eighteen months , after which a single cal@@ f is born .
It is considered the longest ge@@ station periods of any land mam@@ mal , surpassed only by the twenty-@@ two month ge@@ station period of an Ele@@ ph@@ ant .
A newborn R@@ hin@@ o cal@@ f will stand up within one hour of birth . Once born , the cal@@ f will immediately attempt to suc@@ kle , although he or she may be a little un@@ steady on their feet for the first few days .
It will remain under the watch@@ ful eye of the mother , suc@@ kling from her for approximately one year .
Their bond is an inten@@ sely strong one and the cal@@ f will remain with its mother for at least two years , benefiting from her protection . Fem@@ ales guard their offspring aggressively and are intim@@ idating advers@@ aries if challenged .
In@@ cel virgin Alex Min@@ assi@@ an told Toronto police he was part of 4@@ ch@@ an group
Foot@@ age has emerged of a man alleged to have killed 10 pede@@ stri@@ ans in Toronto telling police that he was part of an online group for sexually frustrated men .
Ale@@ k Min@@ assi@@ an , 26 , said that he was part of the involuntary cel@@ i@@ b@@ ates ( inc@@ el ) forum on 4@@ ch@@ an .
He is now facing 10 counts of murder in Canada and 16 counts of attempted murder following the attack on April 23 , 2018 .
When asked about the deaths , he told police : &quot; I feel like I accomplished my mission . &quot;
When the incident happened , it brought attention to the online world of loneliness , rage and mis@@ o@@ gy@@ ny .
Min@@ assi@@ an said that he had contact with a killer in California who was angry at women who had rejected him .
He stands accused of driving a rental van into crowds of pede@@ stri@@ ans in a busy north Toronto neighbourhood . Eight women and two men ranging in age from 22 to 94 died .
Min@@ assi@@ an has yet to enter a plea . His trial begins in February , but a publication ban on his interrogation by police was lifted today . The police interview took place just hours after the attack .
Min@@ assi@@ an , who said he never had a girlfriend and was a virgin , acknowledged he used the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks .
He said : &quot; I know of several other guys over the internet who feel the same way , &quot; but added that they are &quot; too co@@ wardly to act on their anger . &quot;
Min@@ assi@@ an calls himself an &quot; inc@@ el , &quot; short for &quot; involuntary cel@@ i@@ b@@ ate . &quot; The inc@@ el movement is an online sub@@ culture linked to the deadly attack in Toronto as well as attacks in California and Florida . It promotes the mis@@ o@@ gy@@ n@@ istic idea that men are entitled to have sex with women .
Over time , &quot; inc@@ el &quot; has become a bu@@ zz@@ word for certain men in@@ furi@@ ated at being rejected by women and prone to float ideas for violent pay@@ back , according to soci@@ ologists and others who study them .
Li@@ ke-@@ minded people in internet forums sometimes use &quot; Chad &quot; and &quot; St@@ acy &quot; as dismis@@ sive slan@@ g for men and women with more active sex lives .
Min@@ assi@@ an said he discussed his sexual frustr@@ ations on the website 4@@ ch@@ an , which has become notorious as a place for extremists to post their views .
US theater chain bans dressing up for &quot; Jo@@ ker &quot; screen@@ ings over fears of another shooting
The largest US independent theater chain won &apos;t let people in co@@ s@@ play watch the critically ac@@ claimed origin story of Batman super@@ vil@@ lain &quot; Jo@@ ker . &quot; Face paint and masks are already banned , but safety fears still remain .
Most US cinem@@ as have banned masks , face paint and toy weapons after the 2012 mass shooting in A@@ ur@@ ora , Colorado , which happened during a screening of another Batman f@@ lick , &quot; The Dark Knight R@@ ises . &quot; The gun@@ man wore a Jo@@ ker costume when he went on a gun and te@@ ar-@@ gas ramp@@ age , killing 12 people and injuring 70 others . Body costumes that don &apos;t hide a person &apos;s identity , however , have been generally allowed in theat@@ ers .
However , Land@@ mark Theat@@ ers has now announced that it will not allow customers to wear costumes during screen@@ ings of the R-@@ rated &quot; Jo@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I want customers to be comfortable in their surroundings , &quot; Land@@ mark President-@@ CEO Ted M@@ und@@ or@@ ff told the Hollywood Re@@ porter .
The company is based in Lo@@ s-@@ Angeles and runs 52 theat@@ ers in 27 markets , which makes it the biggest specialized theater chain in the country .
Meanwhile , K@@ ans@@ as@@ -based AM@@ C Theat@@ res , the largest chain in the country , reiterated its ban on &quot; masks , face paint or any object that conce@@ als the face , &quot; but said they will welcome viewers in costume .
The ban on masks and fake guns was mostly due to practical security reasons , but as the release of &quot; Jo@@ ker &quot; draws closer , there are concerns that it may trigger a copy@@ cat gun attack . The LA@@ PD said it would &quot; maintain high visibility &quot; around theat@@ ers on premier day , while Reg@@ al Cin@@ em@@ as , the second-@@ largest chain in the country , said it was implementing security protocols developed &quot; in collaboration with NATO . &quot;
The US Army went as far as advising service members to watch out for &quot; inc@@ els , &quot; dis@@ gr@@ un@@ tled males who can &apos;t get a date , who supposedly id@@ ol@@ ize the Jo@@ ker and may mim@@ ic his brutal ways .
&quot; Jo@@ ker , &quot; which is directed by To@@ dd Phil@@ lips and stars Jo@@ aqu@@ in Phoenix as the title character , is due to be released on October 4 in the US , and is expected to become a box office hit . It follows the descent of a socially isolated and mentally un@@ well person , as he becomes the mass@@ -@@ mur@@ dering , green@@ -@@ ha@@ ired , pal@@ e-@@ faced n@@ eme@@ sis of Batman .
It received ra@@ ve reviews at its Venice International Film Festival premiere this year , taking the top prize . The film is a psychological thr@@ iller loosely based on the comic book series . Some commen@@ ters voiced concerns that it may cause harm by depicting the protagonist in a sympathetic way and including graphic and realistic violence . However , the creative team behind it said their work is meant for mature audiences who are expected to be able to tell right from wrong .
Mid@@ way Broadcasting announced today that its Chair@@ woman , Mel@@ ody Span@@ n Cooper is set to release her highly anticipated book to help female entrepreneurs and executives thrive in business . &quot; The Gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s Guide To Closing the Deal &quot; shares insights on how women can use their voice to achieve equity at the negotiating table and advance their careers by using the female edition of the old-@@ boy &apos;s network .
Throughout the book , Span@@ n Cooper uses an@@ ec@@ dot@@ al references to deal with challenging issues including the # Me@@ Too movement and Hillary Clinton &apos;s Presidential defeat and its impact on fu@@ eling the female empowerment in America .
The self-@@ published book is the result of a ground@@ breaking self-@@ entitled speech that Span@@ n Cooper delivered as a keynote address at The National Association of Women Business Ow@@ ners Conference in Chicago in 2017 . The Gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s Guide to Closing The Deal is written in a down@@ -to-@@ earth style that every &quot; girlfriend &quot; can relate .
Christi@@ e H@@ ef@@ ner , business@@ woman and daughter of Play@@ boy F@@ ounder , Hu@@ gh H@@ ef@@ ner , says &quot; The Gir@@ l@@ friend &apos;s Guide to Closing The Deal &quot; is both highly enter@@ taining and very helpful . Mel@@ ody wea@@ ves together personal an@@ ec@@ d@@ otes , triumph@@ s , and setbacks with useful lessons learned . From how to own your ideas in a meeting to when its time to &quot; friend up , &quot; everyone can benefit from Mel@@ ody &apos;s story . &quot;
As Chairman of Mid@@ way Broadcasting Corporation , she joined an elite list of America &apos;s female broadcast owners after purchasing the company &apos;s controlling interest in 1999 . Mid@@ way Broadcasting Corporation is a best-@@ in-@@ class female and family-@@ owned media bou@@ tique whose properties include radio and interactive platforms .
The book was co-@@ written with T. Sha@@ wn Taylor , journalist , writer and founder of Tree Top Consulting , a full-@@ service media consulting firm .
Romania In@@ vests Bil@@ lions in a Black Sea Military Base
Romania will spend 2.5 billion euros to modernize the Black Sea military base as part of counter@@ acting Russia &apos;s growing presence in the region , according to The Times , quoted by the FO@@ C@@ US News Agency . Mi@@ kha@@ il Ko@@ gli@@ gn@@ ic@@ han@@ u Air@@ base , located about 200 k@@ m@@ . east of Bucharest , will be aligned with NATO standards , as evidenced by documents published by local news sites . Up to 10,000 NATO F-@@ 35 soldiers and aircraft can be accommodated there . It is planned to become a &quot; mini-@@ city &quot; for the military with kindergartens , sports clubs and a hospital .
The base has already become a center of increased NATO activity in the Black Sea , which has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West . After Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 , the Kremlin began to increase its naval presence in the Black Sea , using the deep-@@ sea base in Sev@@ ast@@ o@@ pol to carry out naval missions in Syria . Russia is also hampering shipping in the region and last year captured three Ukrainian ships in the Ker@@ ch Strait .
Romania and Bulgaria , located on the Black Sea coast , which in the past were allies of the USSR , have joined NATO and the EU since its collapse . In response to Russia &apos;s actions , they have asked the alliance to strengthen its presence in the region , writes The Times . In February , 500 US troops arrived at Romania &apos;s air base . An Euro@@ fighter Typhoon fighter squadron of the British Air Force is stationed and deployed . Since April last year , these aircraft have repeatedly intercepted Russian fighter jets . Georgia , located on the eastern Black Sea coast , is also concerned about Russia &apos;s aspirations . It is not a member of the alliance , but is involved in NATO military exercises . NATO Secretary General J@@ ens St@@ ol@@ ten@@ berg said during a visit to Tbilisi in March that the alliance was &quot; preparing &quot; Georgia for accession . Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region and has been developing its engagement with the Union since 2014 .
Ukraine , the &quot; New Berlin Wall , &quot; Once Again L@@ ies at the Center of Scan@@ dal
Mr. Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko &apos;s eag@@ er@@ ness to win over Mr. Trump and his growing fears that political rivals would th@@ wart his re-election opened the way for Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani to press Ukraine &apos;s prosecutor general , Y@@ uri L@@ ut@@ sen@@ ko , who has since been fired , to help Mr. Trump &apos;s own re-election by investigating Joe Bi@@ den and his son .
How Mr. Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko expected the Trump administration to help lift his sag@@ ging fortunes ahead of Ukraine &apos;s presidential election , held in two rounds in March and April this year , is unclear . He got tro@@ un@@ ced anyway , losing emph@@ atically to Mr. Zel@@ en@@ sky , whose own officials quickly became the Trump team &apos;s new targets in its drive to damage Mr. Bi@@ den .
While Democrats want Mr. Trump impe@@ ached over his dealings with Ukraine , the president and his allies have counter@@ attacked with their own Ukra@@ ine-@@ focused scand@@ als . They have revived a deb@@ un@@ ked theory that the country coll@@ uded with the Clinton campaign to hurt Mr. Trump &apos;s chances in 2016 and asserted , with little evidence , that Mr. Bi@@ den used his position as vice president to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son .
Ukra@@ ini@@ ans , j@@ aded after years of watching their own leaders trade the power and privileges of office for personal financial or political gain , have mostly shru@@ gged off what , for Mr. Trump , is possibly the most serious scandal to bu@@ ffe@@ t the White House since Water@@ gate top@@ pled President Richard Nixon in 1974 .
That a country few Americans paid much attention to in the past now commands center stage in Washington has stirred mostly b@@ em@@ usement in Ukraine . Those feelings are also tin@@ ged with a touch of pride that , after centuries in the shadow of Russia , its giant neighbor to the north , the nation is no longer seen as a back@@ water but a pi@@ vo@@ t around which the fate of the world &apos;s most powerful country impl@@ au@@ sibly turns .
Pav@@ lo K@@ lim@@ kin , Ukraine &apos;s foreign minister under Mr. Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko , said in a caus@@ tic Twitter message this week that going down in history &quot; as the country that led to the impe@@ achment of the U.S. president &quot; was &quot; not a very fun prospect . &quot; But , he added , &quot; Now everyone understands what we are capable of . &quot;
Brother J@@ ailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Q@@ an@@ de@@ el B@@ alo@@ ch &apos;s Hon@@ our K@@ illing
Q@@ an@@ de@@ el B@@ alo@@ ch , who shot to fame for her social media photos , was str@@ angled in July 2016 .
The brother of Pakistani social media star Q@@ an@@ de@@ el B@@ alo@@ ch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country &apos;s highest-@@ profile &quot; honour killing . &quot;
B@@ alo@@ ch , who shot to fame for her ris@@ que sel@@ fies -- t@@ ame by Western standards , but considered provocative in deeply mis@@ o@@ gy@@ n@@ istic Pakistan -- was str@@ angled in July 2016 .
Her brother Muhammad W@@ ase@@ em was arrested . Days later he told a press conference that he had no re@@ mor@@ se over what he did , saying that &quot; of course &quot; he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been &quot; intolerable . &quot;
His lawyer , S@@ ard@@ ar Meh@@ mood , told A@@ FP the court in the eastern city of Mul@@ tan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment , in a long-@@ awaited verdict .
&quot; In@@ sh@@ allah ( God willing ) , he will be acquitted by a high court , &quot; he said .
Earlier , B@@ alo@@ ch &apos;s mother An@@ war Mai told A@@ FP she had hoped her son would be acquitted .
&quot; He is innocent . She was my daughter and he is my son , &quot; she said .
B@@ alo@@ ch &apos;s murder made international headlines and re@@ ign@@ ited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called &quot; honour killings , &quot; in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for fl@@ outing patriarchal social codes .
Women have been burned , shot , stab@@ bed and str@@ angled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in B@@ alo@@ ch &apos;s case -- bringing &quot; shame &quot; on their family by celebrating their sexuality .
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative . Under Pakistan &apos;s Q@@ is@@ as ( blood money ) and Di@@ y@@ at ( re@@ tribution ) law , they can then seek forgiveness from a victim &apos;s relatives .
Three months after B@@ alo@@ ch &apos;s murder , parliament passed new legislation man@@ dating life imprisonment for honour killings .
However , whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge &apos;s discretion , meaning that kill@@ ers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be par@@ doned .
In B@@ alo@@ ch &apos;s case , her parents initially insisted their son would be given no ab@@ solution .
But , heart@@ broken at the thought of losing him also , they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be for@@ given .
International re@@ vul@@ sion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents , however , forcing the case to move ahead .
Some of B@@ alo@@ ch &apos;s better-@@ known actions included offering to perform a stri@@ p@@ te@@ ase for the Pakistani cricket team , and don@@ ning a plun@@ ging scar@@ let dress on Valentine &apos;s Day .
She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many , including young people , as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim K@@ ard@@ as@@ hi@@ an-@@ like figure can be seen as a bold , political act of women &apos;s empowerment .
The roots of &quot; honour &quot; killings lie in tribal social norms , which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular , though men can be victims too .
Three Scottish students named among Europe &apos;s best
Three University of D@@ unde@@ e students have been named regional winners as top graduates in Europe .
The University of D@@ unde@@ e students were named as top graduates in their respective fields in Europe in the 2019 Global Under@@ graduate Awards , whilst five other students from the same university were praised by the judges .
Scott Shel@@ d@@ rick , who graduated in Mol@@ ec@@ ular Gene@@ tics , won the Europe award for Life Sciences , Che@@ ster Corn@@ ford studied MS@@ c Mental Health Nursing and was awarded the Nursing , Mid@@ wi@@ f@@ ery &amp; Allied He@@ alth@@ care prize , whilst L@@ ola K@@ ni@@ b@@ b won the Visual Arts award .
Although all three made it through to the global final , they lost out in the final round to strong competition from some of the 3,500 entr@@ ants from across the world .
Professor Blair G@@ rub@@ b , Vice-@@ Principal ( Education ) at the University , said : &quot; To get to this stage , our students and graduates faced competition from peers attending some of the world &apos;s top universities .
&quot; The Under@@ graduate Awards are fierc@@ ely contested by thousands of students around the world and it is a great reflection of the quality of our students , and the education they receive here , that D@@ unde@@ e is so strongly represented amongst the prize winners .
&quot; I would like to offer my warm@@ est congratulations to Scott , Che@@ ster and L@@ ola on this fantastic achievement , alongside the other D@@ unde@@ e representatives who were highly commended . &quot;
Another five students were commended in the world &apos;s leading undergraduate awards programme , which recognises top work completed by under@@ graduates to share this with a global audience .
Includ@@ ed in the five praised students were Nicholas Gall@@ ag@@ her and James Os@@ bourne ( both Life Sciences ) , Fe@@ ren@@ c Ko@@ h@@ su@@ ke I@@ shi@@ k@@ awa Gu@@ tai ( Medicine ) , Ca@@ it@@ lyn Scott ( An@@ atom@@ ical Sciences ) and W@@ aco Yoko@@ yama ( Philosophy ) .
The competition further celebr@@ ates top undergraduate cour@@ se@@ work and helps create collabor@@ ations between students and recent graduates worldwide .
O@@ ld@@ est galaxy pro@@ to@@ cluster forms &apos; queen &apos;s cour@@ t@@ &apos;
Using the Sub@@ ar@@ u , K@@ eck , and Gem@@ ini Teles@@ cop@@ es , an international team of astronomers has discovered a collection of 12 galaxies which existed about 13.@@ 0 billion years ago . This is the earliest pro@@ to@@ cluster ever found . One of the 12 galaxies is a giant object , known as Him@@ i@@ ko , which was discovered a decade ago by the Sub@@ ar@@ u Telescope and named for a myth@@ ological queen in ancient Japan . This discovery suggests that large structures such as pro@@ to@@ clusters already existed when the Universe was only about 800 million years old , 6 percent of its present age .
In the present Universe , galaxy clusters can contain hundreds of members , but how these clusters form is a big question in astronomy . To understand the formation of clusters , astronomers search for possible pro@@ gen@@ itors in the ancient Universe . A pro@@ to@@ cluster is a dense system of dozens of galaxies in the early Universe , growing into a cluster .
Yu@@ ichi H@@ ari@@ k@@ ane , a JS@@ PS fellow at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan who led the team of astronomers explains , &quot; A pro@@ to@@ cluster is a rare and special system with an extremely high density , and not easy to find . To overcome this problem , we used the wide field of view of the Sub@@ ar@@ u Telescope to map a large area of the sky and look for pro@@ to@@ clusters . &quot;
In the map of the Universe made by the Sub@@ ar@@ u Telescope , the team discovered a pro@@ to@@ cluster candidate , z@@ 66@@ OD , where galaxies are 15 times more concentrated than normal for that era . The team then conducted follow-up spectro@@ scopic observations using the W.@@ M. K@@ eck Observatory and Gem@@ ini North telescope , and confirmed 12 galaxies which existed 13.@@ 0 billion years ago , making it the earliest pro@@ to@@ cluster known to date .
Inte@@ res@@ tingly , one of the 12 galaxies in z@@ 66@@ OD was a giant object with a huge body of gas , known as Him@@ i@@ ko , which was found previously by the Sub@@ ar@@ u Telescope in 2009 . &quot; It is reasonable to find a pro@@ to@@ cluster near a massive object , such as Him@@ i@@ ko . However , we &apos;re surprised to see that Him@@ i@@ ko was located not in the center of the pro@@ to@@ cluster , but on the edge 500 million light-@@ years away from the center . &quot; said Mas@@ ami Ou@@ chi , a team member at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo , who discovered Him@@ i@@ ko in 2009 . Iron@@ ically , the myth@@ ological queen Him@@ i@@ ko is also said to have lived clo@@ i@@ stered away from her people . Ou@@ chi continues , &quot; It is still not understood why Him@@ i@@ ko is not located in the center . These results will be a key for understanding the relationship between clusters and massive galaxies . &quot;
Nancy Pel@@ os@@ i is subject of book by daughter Chris@@ tine Pel@@ os@@ i
An upcoming book on House Speaker Nancy Pel@@ os@@ i comes from someone who knows her well , daughter Chris@@ tine Pel@@ os@@ i .
&quot; The Nancy Pel@@ os@@ i Way &quot; will be released Nov@@ . 26 , Sky@@ horse Publishing announced Thursday . Chris@@ tine Pel@@ os@@ i &apos;s book will examine how a mother of five became the first female house speaker and her current leadership of House Democrats during the Trump administration . According to Sky@@ horse , Chris@@ tine Pel@@ os@@ i will we@@ ave together &quot; the professional and personal experiences &quot; of her mother .
Chris@@ tine Pel@@ os@@ i is a Democratic Party strateg@@ ist and author of &quot; Campaign Boo@@ t Camp &quot; and &quot; Campaign Boo@@ t Camp 2.0 . &quot; Pel@@ os@@ i &apos;s sister , Alexan@@ dra Pel@@ os@@ i , is a film@@ maker and journalist who has made several document@@ aries about contemporary politics .
Warren &apos;s lem@@ on@@ ade money went to a pro-@@ life charity
When Sen@@ . Elizabeth Warren ( D. , Mass . ) purchased drinks from two girls running a lem@@ on@@ ade stand in August , she may not have been aware that her $ 10 purchase would be donated to a pro-@@ life charity .
&quot; Our daughters thought &#91; Warren &#93; was nice , &quot; Dan Michel@@ s , a Trump supporter and a father to one of the girls , told the Washington Free Be@@ acon . &quot; She came by and told us we should vote for her . And our daughters told us she was a nice person , but we don &apos;t align with her politically and ... because she &apos;s pro-@@ choice , we said we should donate her money to a pro-@@ life &#91; cause &#93; . &quot;
On August 8 , Warren stopped by a lem@@ on@@ ade stand staffed by two 11-@@ year-old children , Si@@ enna Michel@@ s and Aud@@ rey Bill@@ ings , during a campaign bus tour across Iowa .
&quot; St@@ op@@ ped for a quick drink at a lem@@ on@@ ade stand in Har@@ lan , Iowa . When life gives you lem@@ ons , make big structural change ! &quot; Warren said on Twitter .
The two kids were excited about meeting a presidential candidate in person . The Michel@@ s girl urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020 after the photo op . The parents instead explained Warren &apos;s stance on abortion . The girls and their parents decided to donate to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund , a non-profit that supports pro-@@ life legislation .
&quot; My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her , &quot; Michel@@ s said . &quot; We talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion , and my daughter was all for that . &quot;
Why viruses like Her@@ pes and Z@@ ika will need to be reclassified : Bi@@ ot@@ ech impact
New research reveals that the way viruses were perceived in terms of their architecture will need to be re@@ tool@@ ed , because they are actually structured in many more patterns than previously understood . The findings could have significant impact on how they are classified , our understanding of how they form , evolve and infec@@ t hosts , and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target them .
In the 1950s and &apos; 6@@ 0s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses , they discovered the detailed structure of the cap@@ si@@ d -- an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein -- which protects the virus &apos; genetic material . The majority of viruses have cap@@ si@@ ds that are typically quasi-@@ spherical and display ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral symmetry -- like a 20-@@ sided dice for instance .
The cap@@ si@@ d shell is what protects them , and as scientists discovered their structure , they proposed that cap@@ si@@ ds could have different sizes and hold different amounts of genome , and therefore could infec@@ t hosts differently .
Why this matters
When designing drugs to target viruses , scientists can now take their varying structural shapes into account to improve efficacy .
Two researchers who study the structures of viruses , Anton@@ i Lu@@ que , a theoretical bi@@ ophy@@ sic@@ ist at San Diego State University and a member of its Vir@@ al Information Institute , and Re@@ id@@ un T@@ war@@ ock , a mathematical bi@@ ologist from the University of York , UK , and a member of York &apos;s Cross-@@ disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis , show that many viruses have essentially been mis@@ classified for 60 years , including common viruses such as Her@@ pes sim@@ plex and Z@@ ika .
This was because despite having the structural images from cr@@ y@@ o-@@ electron micro@@ scopy , we did not have the mathematical description of many of the architec@@ tures of different viruses .
&quot; We discovered six new ways in which proteins can organize to form ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ si@@ d shells , &quot; Lu@@ que said . &quot; So , many viruses don &apos;t adopt only the two broadly understood cap@@ si@@ d architec@@ tures . There are now at least eight ways in which their ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ si@@ ds could be designed . &quot;
They used a gener@@ alization of the quasi@@ equivalence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ si@@ d .
Their study , which will be published in Nature Communications on Friday , September 27 , also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural line@@ age , based on the protein that they &apos;re composed of , adopt consistent ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ si@@ d la@@ you@@ ts , providing a new approach to study virus evolution .
Bi@@ ot@@ ech applications
Structural bi@@ ologists can now take this information and re@@ classify the structure of the viruses , which will help unve@@ il molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses .
It will also provide a guide to engineer new molecular containers for nan@@ ot@@ ech and bi@@ ot@@ ech applications , and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the cap@@ si@@ d . This can eventually lead to a more systematic approach to developing anti@@ viral vaccines .
&quot; We can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the cap@@ si@@ d , to either prevent the formation of the virus when it infec@@ ts the host cell , or break it apart after it &apos;s formed , &quot; Lu@@ que said . &quot; This could facilitate the characterization and identification of anti@@ viral targets for viruses sharing the same ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral layout . &quot;
This new framework accommod@@ ates viruses that were previously out@@ li@@ ers , provides new predictions of viral cap@@ si@@ d architec@@ tures , and has identified common geome@@ tr@@ ical patterns among distant evolutionary related viruses that infec@@ t everyone from humans to bacteria .
T@@ war@@ ock said the new bluepr@@ ints also provide &quot; a new perspective on viral evolution , suggesting novel routes in which larger and more complex viruses may have evolved from simple ones at evolutionary tim@@ escal@@ es . &quot;
Architec@@ tural applications
The geome@@ tries could be also used in new architectural designs in buildings and construction .
Since the 1960s , these viral cap@@ si@@ ds have been classified using the geome@@ tr@@ ical framework introduced by structural bi@@ ologist Donald Cas@@ par and bi@@ ophy@@ sic@@ ist Aaron K@@ lu@@ g , which were inspired by the geo@@ de@@ sic dom@@ es designed by the renowned architect R. Buck@@ minster Ful@@ ler . However , as molecular imaging techniques have advanced , an increasing number of 3D viral cap@@ si@@ d re@@ construc@@ tions that included viruses like Her@@ pes or Z@@ ika have fallen out from this classical geome@@ tr@@ ical framework .
&quot; This study introduces a more general framework than the classic Cas@@ par@@ -@@ K@@ lu@@ g construction . It is based on the conservation of the local ver@@ tices formed by the proteins that interact in the cap@@ si@@ d , &quot; Lu@@ que explained . &quot; This approach led to the discovery of six new types of ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ si@@ d la@@ you@@ ts , while recovering the two classical la@@ you@@ ts from Cas@@ par@@ -@@ K@@ lu@@ g based on Gold@@ berg and geo@@ de@@ sic poly@@ he@@ dra . &quot;
Pri@@ est who sexually abused boys in Wisconsin gets 30 years
A former priest accused of sexually assa@@ ul@@ ting young boys in Wisconsin decades ago has been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
The W@@ aus@@ au Daily Her@@ ald reports that 7@@ 2-@@ year-old Thomas E@@ ric@@ k@@ sen received the maximum sentence Thursday on two charges of sexually assa@@ ul@@ ting young boys while stationed at St. Peter &apos;s Catholic Church in Winter in the late 7@@ 0s and early 80s . He must register as a sex offender for life .
Four men testified Thursday about how the assaults affected their lives . One of the victims went public for the first time .
E@@ ric@@ k@@ sen apolog@@ ized to the victims in court and said he has come to realize the impact the assaults had on victims . At least 11 men claim they were abused by E@@ ric@@ k@@ sen during his time in the clergy .
E@@ ric@@ k@@ sen was removed from the pri@@ es@@ thood in 1988 .
Having Too Much Of This Sp@@ ice Could Damage Li@@ ver
Made from the inner bark of the Cin@@ nam@@ om@@ um tree , cin@@ nam@@ on is a widely popular sp@@ ice , earning itself a place in a large variety of food and even becoming a flavor itself .
And all for good reason since the sp@@ ice is host to some very impressive health benefits , such as lowering the risk of life-@@ threatening diseases like heart disease , cancer and even diabetes .
But hold your horses just yet since too much of a good thing can be harmful , very harmful . And in this case , here are some side effects one can get if they eat too much cin@@ nam@@ on . Stay safe out there .
May increase the risk of cancer - Unfortunately , while cin@@ nam@@ on can help lower the risk of cancer , it can also very much contribute to the development of it . Per animal studies , consuming too much cou@@ mar@@ in , which is commonly found in C@@ assi@@ a cin@@ nam@@ on , may increase the risk of cancer development . Per scientists , cou@@ mar@@ in does this by supposedly damaging our D@@ N@@ As over time .
May cause liver damage - Per studies , too much cou@@ mar@@ in can also be responsible for liver toxicity and damage . This is according to several studies made on the effects of too much cou@@ mar@@ in in our bodies .
May cause mouth so@@ res - Not only does too much cin@@ nam@@ on help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth so@@ res .

Tennessee &apos;s abortion waiting period trial goes to judge
A federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over Tennessee &apos;s 4@@ 8-@@ hour waiting period law for abortions .
Over the course of a four-@@ day trial in N@@ ash@@ ville that concluded Thursday , the state tried to show that the law , which requires women to make two separate trips to a clinic at least 48 hours apart , benefits women by allowing them time to reflect on their decisions . Attor@@ neys representing five of the state &apos;s seven abortion clinics argued the law provides no benefits and causes significant burdens .
Experts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions are uncertain , and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision . But they differed on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abortions . The experts also disagreed on whether Tennessee &apos;s 4@@ 8-@@ hour waiting period would make any difference for those women .
On Thursday , attorneys for the state introduced a study from Utah on the effects of a 7@@ 2-@@ hour waiting period there . It found that 8 % of participating women who attended an initial counselling visit later said they were no longer seeking an abortion .
Qu@@ esti@@ oned about the study , Anton@@ ia Big@@ gs , a social psychologist researcher at the University of California San Francisco , agreed that some women change their minds about having an abortion or are uncertain to begin with . But she noted that the study did not find that Utah &apos;s mandatory waiting period caused women to change their minds or that it was otherwise beneficial to women .
Big@@ gs also testified that there is no evidence that abortion causes women to have mental health problems . She said a national study comparing women seeking abortions who were just under the cu@@ to@@ ff date to obtain them with a group of women who were over the cu@@ to@@ ff and were turned away from clinics found no difference in the rates of issues like depression and post-@@ traumatic stress .
Under cross-@@ examination Big@@ gs said the study did not follow the mental health outcomes of women in states with waiting periods who changed their minds about having an abortion , although there were only three women like that identified in the study . She re@@ but@@ ted testimony from earlier in the week by Pris@@ c@@ illa Col@@ eman , a psychology professor at Bow@@ ling Green State University in Ohio , who said that abortion is associated with mental health problems .
Col@@ eman testified that she believes most of the scientific literature on abortion is politically biased in favor of abortions .
Thursday also included testimony for the state from a M@@ emp@@ his obste@@ tric@@ ian and gy@@ nec@@ ologist who participates in a controversial network that attempts to halt the effects of abor@@ tion-@@ inducing medication . Dr. Michael Po@@ dra@@ za said that through that work he has &quot; personal experience with women who have changed their minds about an abortion . &quot;
Tennessee &apos;s waiting period law went into effect in mid-@@ 2015 , and Po@@ dra@@ za said he has seen several women since then who wanted to try to reverse a medical abortion that was already underway . Some of those women then changed their minds a second time and followed through with the abortion , he testified . These re@@ vers@@ als happened in spite of the waiting period .
Clinic directors previously testified the wait period causes women financial hardship and stress . They also said the two-@@ visit requirement poses logistical challenges for patients and clinics that cause abortions to be delayed far beyond the 48 hours required by law , pushing some women into surgical abortions , which have greater risks of complications . A few women are pushed beyond the time when they can receive an abortion altogether .
Tennessee is one of 14 states with laws requiring women to make two trips to an abortion clinic according to the Gu@@ t@@ t@@ m@@ acher Institute , a research group that supports abortion rights .
In determining whether Tennessee &apos;s waiting period violates the U.S. Constitution , U.S. District Judge Bernard Fre@@ id@@ man must determine whether it places an undue burden on women seeking abortion . It &apos;s a subjective standard that has caused some waiting period laws to be struck down and others upheld , depending on the specific circumstances of the state .
After both sides rested their cases on Thursday , Fried@@ man said he would rule as quickly as possible .
French chemical fire extingu@@ ished as questions mount
French authorities and Nor@@ man@@ dy residents are clearing up residue from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul sten@@ ch continues to spread over a sw@@ ath of territory .
No one was injured in Thursday &apos;s fire at a lubric@@ ant plant in Rou@@ en , but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby Se@@ ine River .
The head of the regional administration said Friday the fire was extingu@@ ished Thursday night after nearly 24 hours . Fire@@ fighters are still on the scene .
The administration warned of a new odor released after the fire was put out , saying it could spread to neighboring regions .
Interior Minister Christop@@ he Ca@@ stan@@ er said people in fragile health should remain in@@ doors through Friday night .
The cause of the fire is being investigated . The plant is among the highest-@@ risk industrial sites in Europe .
L@@ NG investments hit record in 2019 &amp; the biggest growth is coming from China
Investments in li@@ que@@ fied natural gas since the start of the year have hit an all-@@ time high of $ 50 billion , the International Energy Agency &apos;s head , Fati@@ h Bi@@ rol , told an industry conference .
&quot; This year , 2019 already broke the highest amount of ( final investment decisions ) for the first time ever , $ 50 billion , &quot; Bi@@ rol told the L@@ NG Produc@@ er-@@ Consumer conference in Tokyo , as quoted by Reuters .
Un@@ surprisingly , the driver of this growth in investments is growing demand for the fuel in Asia , with China still expected to over@@ take Japan as the world &apos;s top importer of L@@ NG .
&quot; The biggest growth is coming from China . In the next five years , about one-third of global L@@ NG demand will come from China alone , &quot; Bi@@ rol said . He added that in five years , China will become the largest importer of the fuel .
As for the growth in investments , there are no sur@@ prises there , either . The bulk of these has been made in the United States and Canada .
In a December 2018 report the Energy Information Administration said it expected the United States &quot; L@@ NG export capacity to double by the end of this year to 8.9 billion cu ft daily . This will make the US the third-@@ largest exporter of L@@ NG in terms of capacity after Qatar and Australia . By 2030 , US L@@ NG exports are estimated to reach 17 billion cu ft daily , from some 3 billion cu ft at the start of 2019 .
In Canada , there is just one L@@ NG project under development right now - L@@ NG Canada - but it could have a final capacity of 28 million tons of the fuel annually . The US $ 31-@@ billion project is led by Shell , with minority participants including Pe@@ tr@@ on@@ as , Petro@@ China , Mit@@ sub@@ ishi , and Ko@@ gas .
Meanwhile , Qatar is stepping up its efforts to keep its num@@ ber-@@ one spot in the global L@@ NG export race . The country has lifted a moratorium on new drilling in its North Field - the world &apos;s largest offshore gas field Qatar shares with Iran - aiming to boost export capacity by 43 percent to 11 million tons annually .
Global L@@ NG demand is seen at 550 million tons by 2030 , according to projections by I@@ HS Mar@@ kit .
Viol@@ a Davis Dro@@ ps Some Truth Bom@@ bs About Pla@@ ying Michelle Obama On &apos; Jimmy Kim@@ mel@@ &apos;
Viol@@ a Davis is feeling the pressure of playing Michelle Obama .
&quot; I &apos;m terri@@ fied , &quot; the actor said on &quot; Jimmy Kim@@ mel Live &quot; Thursday .
It was announced last month that Davis would star as the former first lady in Sh@@ ow@@ time &apos;s dram@@ atized &quot; First Ladies &quot; anth@@ ology series . Davis said the script is great , but she &apos;s keen@@ ly aware of the burden to get her performance right .
&quot; I don &apos;t care what else I &apos;ve done in my life ― I won an Em@@ my , I won an Oscar , two Ton@@ ys ― but if I mess this up , this &apos;ll be the defining moment in my life , &quot; she told host Kim@@ mel .
Davis said she &apos;s waiting for her public@@ ist &quot; to call and say , &quot; Hold the line , it &apos;s Michelle Obama ― to cus@@ s your ass out . &quot; &quot;
Davis , in her sixth and final season of &quot; How To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , &quot; is also thinking of the audience .
&quot; Listen , I don &apos;t want to make my people mad , &quot; she said .
Judge shows concern for violent teen &apos;s choice of drink on attack night
A judge sentencing a teenager for a violent attack on a love rival appeared to show just as much concern about his choice of drink in the lead up to it .
Ki@@ er@@ an C@@ lif@@ ton , 19 , battered a 17-@@ year-old he blamed for the end of his relationship with a former girlfriend .
Oxford Crown Court heard C@@ lif@@ ton had been drinking mix@@ ers at the F@@ at Fox pu@@ b in Wat@@ l@@ ington , Ox@@ for@@ d@@ shire , shortly before the assault in March last year .
Judge Ni@@ gel Dal@@ y told C@@ lif@@ ton , who admitted AB@@ H , that the alcohol had &quot; played a significant part &quot; in the night &apos;s violence .
But he remarked of C@@ lif@@ ton &apos;s choice of ti@@ p@@ ple : &quot; Dr@@ inking Coc@@ a Cola and Ama@@ ret@@ to ? I &apos;m surprised you were not sick ! &quot;
C@@ lif@@ ton , from Ch@@ al@@ grove , was handed a 12-month sentence , suspended for 12 months , ordered to complete a 15-@@ day rehabilitation activity requirement along with 160 hours &quot; unpaid work and pay £ 750 compensation .

Leader of Colombia &apos;s Los Pel@@ us@@ os crime gang killed , president says
The top leader and founder of Colombia &apos;s Los Pel@@ us@@ os crime gang has been killed in an operation led by the national police , President Ivan Du@@ que said on Friday .
The gang is one of the most well-known criminal organizations in the Andean country and involved in fighting that has endangered hundreds of thousands of people in areas along the eastern border with Venezuela .
Luis Antonio Qu@@ inter@@ o , known by his ali@@ as Pac@@ ora , was a former lef@@ tist rebel who commanded some 440 gang members , the government said .
The 4@@ 9-@@ year-old was wanted on terrorism and murder charges and located in Nor@@ te de San@@ tan@@ der province on Thursday .
&quot; It &apos;s clear we are going to completely break up this group , &quot; Du@@ que said in a statement from the United States , where he traveled for the United Nations General Assembly this week .
Qu@@ inter@@ o was responsible for the killings of human rights activists and community leaders , the statement added .
Du@@ que has faced criticism from some in the international community for not doing more to stop killings of activists from being committed with impunity across the country .
Another leader of Los Pel@@ us@@ os was captured in the operation , the statement added . It did not provide details about the circumstances of Qu@@ inter@@ o &apos;s death .
&apos;@@ How dare you ? &apos; Th@@ un@@ berg &apos;s U.N. speech in@@ spi@@ res Dutch climate protesters
Thousands of Dutch children sk@@ ipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday , blocking traffic and asking their leaders &quot; how dare you ? &quot; in a reference to Swedish teenage activist G@@ ret@@ a Th@@ un@@ berg &apos;s speech at the United Nations .
A participant holds a drawing depicting Swedish environmental activist G@@ ret@@ a Th@@ un@@ berg during a protest march to call for action against climate change , in The Hague , Netherlands September 27 , 2019 . RE@@ U@@ TERS / Pi@@ ro@@ sch@@ ka van de W@@ ou@@ w
Tur@@ n@@ out at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000 . Police were forced to re@@ route the march to a location with more space .
Th@@ un@@ berg , 16 , gave an imp@@ assi@@ oned address at the United Nations in New York this week , after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit .
&quot; This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up , not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life , &quot; said prote@@ ster Rein@@ der Ru@@ st@@ ema .
Ban@@ ging drums and holding pictures of Th@@ un@@ berg , protesters walked through the city center with plac@@ ards reading : &quot; For the G@@ ret@@ a good , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be a fossil fool , &quot; and &quot; You will die of old age , we will die of climate change . &quot;
&quot; I understand their concerns , I believe they are being heard , &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rut@@ te told journalists at a weekly press briefing within ear@@ shot of the protests . &quot; We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems . But we have to do it in a smart way , which also creates jobs . &quot;
Th@@ un@@ berg &apos;s brief address electri@@ fied the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions , which hit record high@@ s last year despite decades of warnings from scientists .
&quot; This is all wrong . I shouldn &apos;t be up here . I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope . How dare you ? &quot; she said , her voice qu@@ a@@ vering with emotion .
The Netherlands , with 17 million inhabitants , generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017 , compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden .
The government has pledged to hal@@ ve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 , but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut .
Th@@ un@@ berg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets .
Military Se@@ es Fru@@ str@@ ating Tren@@ d As Su@@ icides Spi@@ ke
Military su@@ icides sur@@ ged this year to a record high among active duty troops , continuing a deadly trend that Pent@@ agon officials say is frustr@@ ating and they are struggling to counter .
The Army , Navy and Marine Corps all saw the rate of su@@ icides go up as well as the overall numbers , with only the Air Force showing a decrease , according to data released by the Pent@@ agon Thursday . Su@@ icides among members of the Reser@@ ves and the National Guard also grew .
The difficulties involved in identifying service members with possible problems and finding ways to prevent su@@ icides were underscored earlier this month when the Navy reported that three crew members who served on the US@@ S George H.@@ W. Bush took their own lives within a week .
Asked about the deaths in the crew of the aircraft carrier , Defense Secretary Mark Es@@ per said , &quot; I wish I could tell you we have an answer to prevent further , future su@@ icides in the Armed Services . We don &apos;t . We are caught up in what some call a national epidemic of suicide among our youth . &quot;
The number of su@@ icides across the military increased from 5@@ 11 in 2017 to 5@@ 41 in 2018 . According to the Pent@@ agon , the most at-risk population is young enlisted men , and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method . Army su@@ icides went from 114 to 139 , while the Mar@@ ines went from 43 to 58 and the Navy went from 65 to 68 . The Air Force di@@ pped from 63 to 60 .
&quot; Our numbers are not moving in the right direction , &quot; said Elizabeth Van Win@@ kle , director of the Pent@@ agon &apos;s office of force resili@@ ency . She said that most of the military rates are comparable to civilians , but added , &quot; that &apos;s hardly comfor@@ ting . &quot;
Military and defense leaders expressed dis@@ may and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force , train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it . Van Win@@ kle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of firearms and medication . She said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on firearms , but that some states or bases have their own restrictions .
She and Karen Or@@ vis , director of the suicide prevention office , said recognizing service members who may be struggling or at risk of taking their own lives is very difficult , and that sometimes suicide is a sudden , im@@ pul@@ sive decision with little warning . They said it &apos;s difficult to identify reasons for suicide because there are so many stresses that could contribute .
They also acknowledged that service members are reluctant to come forward and seek help , because they worry that it could affect promotions or security clear@@ ances . And military leaders said they must all work harder to address those perceived road@@ blocks .
&quot; Just as we talk about physical fitness , mark@@ s@@ manship , training and education , Mar@@ ines must also be comfortable discussing life &apos;s struggles , mental well@@ ness and suicide , &quot; said Gen@@ . David Ber@@ ger , comman@@ dant of the Marine Corps . &quot; We must create a community where seeking help and assistance are simply normal , important decisions Mar@@ ines and sailors make . &quot;
This year for the first time , the Pent@@ agon included statistics for su@@ icides by military spouses and depen@@ dents . Van Win@@ kle said the most recent numbers available were for 2017 , but officials are working to get better at collecting family data .
According to the report , there were 186 families that had su@@ icides - 123 were spouses and 63 were depen@@ dents between the ages of 12 and 23 .
The vast majority - nearly 70 percent - were female spouses under the age of 40 , while 70 percent of the dependent su@@ icides were males . About half of the depen@@ dents who died by suicide were at least 18 years old and , for those younger than that , most of the deaths were youth between 15 and 17 .

The com@@ edi@@ an noted how Trump had visited the El Pas@@ o , Texas , hospital where victims of the weekend &apos;s mass shooting are being treated while his campaign still owed the city more than half a million dollars for a political rally in February .

Man gets prison after woman finds bullet in her skull
A Georgia man has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend , who didn &apos;t realize she survived a bullet to the brain until she went to the hospital for treatment of head@@ aches .

Sony , Disney Back To Work On Third Sp@@ id@@ er-@@ Man Film
Looks like there will be a hom@@ ec@@ oming of sorts for Sp@@ id@@ er-@@ Man , now that Disney and Sony have settled their differences .
The two studios announced on Friday that they will collaborate on a third Sp@@ id@@ er-@@ Man film starring Tom Holland .
The as yet un@@ titled film will be released on July 16 , 20@@ 21 , and be produced by the Dis@@ ne@@ y-@@ owned Mar@@ vel Studios and its president , Kevin Fe@@ ig@@ e , according to a press release sent by both studios .
Amy Pas@@ cal will also produce through Pas@@ cal Pictures , as she has on the first two Hol@@ land-@@ led films , the release said .
&quot; I am thr@@ illed that Sp@@ ide@@ y &apos;s journey in the MC@@ U will continue , and I and all of us at Mar@@ vel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it , &quot; Fe@@ ig@@ e said in the release . &quot; Sp@@ id@@ er-@@ Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe . &quot;
The agreement also allows Sp@@ ide@@ y to appear in a future Mar@@ vel Studios film .
Fe@@ ig@@ e acknowledged the collaboration makes the web@@ sl@@ inger unique among super@@ heroes .
&quot; &#91; Sp@@ id@@ er-@@ Man &#93; happens to be the only hero with the super@@ power to cross cin@@ ematic uni@@ verses , so as Sony continues to develop their own Sp@@ ide@@ y-@@ verse you never know what sur@@ prises the future might hold , &quot; he said .
The end to the Sp@@ ide@@ y stan@@ do@@ ff came more than a month after it was reported the two studios were unable to reach terms on a deal for a sequel to their previous films , &quot; Hom@@ ec@@ oming &quot; and &quot; Far From Home . &quot;
The sticking point was that Disney ― which owns the character ― reportedly wanted a co-financing stake in future films with Sony , which has the film rights thanks to deals set up before the M@@ ouse bought Mar@@ vel in 2009 .
The Hollywood Re@@ porter notes both sides had good reason to come together . &quot; Far From Home &quot; is Sony &apos;s biggest box office hit ever , while Mar@@ vel gets to maximize merchan@@ dis@@ ing and keep creative control .
One person who was happy the impasse has ended was Holland himself , who expressed his joy on In@@ stag@@ ram .
EU , British negotiators work toward Brexit deal in Belgium
The European Union &apos;s chief Brexit negoti@@ ator began talks With British officials in Belgium Friday to work toward an agreement , with about a month remaining before the departure deadline .
Michel Bar@@ ni@@ er met with Brexit secretary Stephen Bar@@ clay in Brussels , who was ad@@ am@@ ant the Irish &quot; back@@ stop &quot; be stripped from any deal . The back@@ stop , effectively an assurance of a soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Britain leaves , has been perhaps the chief obstacle in negotiations .
While Bar@@ clay said Britain is committed to finding a deal , he said there isn &apos;t much time left .
&quot; I think there is still a long way to go . I think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations , &quot; he said .
The deadline to leave the EU is Oc@@ t. 31 , but a new British law prevents Prime Minister Bor@@ is Johnson from completing the withdrawal without a trade agreement , or Parliament &apos;s approval to leave without one by Oc@@ t. 19 .
Last week , EU negotiators said they are open to an alternative to the back@@ stop -- but Irish deputy Simon Coven@@ ey said Friday London hasn &apos;t yet submitted a &quot; serious &quot; proposal .
&quot; Until there is a serious proposal , which can be the basis of negotiations , then the gaps which are wide at the moment will remain , &quot; he said .
He added that &quot; time is running out &quot; and &quot; the on@@ us is on the British prime minister and his team &quot; to put serious proposals on the table .
Johnson &apos;s office said Friday there are still &quot; significant obstacles &quot; to a deal .
&quot; From an Irish perspective , we of course think that an extension is preferable to a no-@@ deal , &quot; Coven@@ ey said . &quot; But I think there would have to be good reason behind that to ask for an extension . &quot;
EU President Jean-@@ Claude Jun@@ c@@ ker said he and Bar@@ ni@@ er are doing everything they can for a deal and if they fail , it &apos;s Britain &apos;s fault .
Irish Prime Minister Leo Var@@ ad@@ kar said he &apos;s not optimistic about a deal , but urged British leaders to present a plan at a Brexit summit on Oc@@ t. 17 .
&quot; The withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty , &quot; he said . &quot; It &apos;s not the kind of thing that can be amended or co@@ b@@ bled together late at night . &quot;
Scientists puzz@@ led by really big planet orbiting really little star
Scientists are expressing surprise after discovering a solar system 30 light-@@ years away from Earth that de@@ fies current understanding about planet formation , with a large Jup@@ iter@@ -like planet orbiting a dimin@@ u@@ tive star known as a red dwarf .
An artistic impression of the gas giant planet G@@ J 35@@ 12@@ b orbiting its red dwarf host star , released on September 26 , 2019 .
Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them . But in this case , the star and the planet are not much different in size , the researchers said on Thursday .
The star , called G@@ J 35@@ 12 , is about 12 % the size of our sun , while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter , our solar system &apos;s largest planet .
&quot; Yes , an absolute surprise , &quot; said astro@@ physicist Juan Carlos Mor@@ ales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catal@@ onia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain , who led the research published in the journal Science .
&quot; The discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low-@@ mass stars typically host small planets , similar to Earth or small Nept@@ un@@ es . In this case , we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star , &quot; Mor@@ ales added .
The planet , which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas , was discovered using a telescope at the Cal@@ ar Al@@ to Observatory in Spain . It travels around its star in a very ellip@@ tical orbit lasting 204 days .
Red dwar@@ fs are small , with relatively low surface temperatures . G@@ J 35@@ 12 is not only much smaller than our sun , it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet , being only about 35 % bigger than Jupiter .
&quot; They emit less energy , so they are fain@@ ter than the sun , and their surface temperature is rather cool , below 3@@ 800 ( degrees ) Kel@@ vin ( 6,@@ 380 degrees F@@ ah@@ ren@@ he@@ it / 3,5@@ 27 Cel@@ sius ) approximately . This is why the have a red@@ dish color , &quot; Mor@@ ales said .
There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star , while a third planet might have been e@@ jected from the star system in the past , explaining the ellip@@ tical orbit of the Jup@@ iter@@ -like planet , Mor@@ ales said .
Plan@@ ets are born from the same disk of inter@@ stellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit . Under the leading model for planetary formation , called the &quot; core ac@@ cre@@ tion &quot; model , an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tu@@ g of this embry@@ onic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas .
A competing model , called the gravitational instability model , may explain this unusual system .
&quot; In this case , the pro@@ to@@ planetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold , &quot; Mor@@ ales said . &quot; This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear . These clum@@ ps can grow until they collapse , forming a planet . &quot;
School stri@@ kers around the world march to demand action on climate
Children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change Friday , in their first major action since the issue topped world leader &apos;s agenda at the United Nations this week .
The Fri@@ days for Future movement that began as a l@@ one demonstration by Swedish teen G@@ ret@@ a Th@@ un@@ ber@@ g@@ just over a year ago has mush@@ ro@@ omed , with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New Yor@@ k@@ and attracting attention in developing nations across Africa .
Some of the first protests began in New Zealand , where Th@@ un@@ berg said@@ organizers estimated 17@@ 0,000 people marched across the country . There were also mar@@ ches in cities in Italy , Finland , Nigeria , Austria and India , among other countries .
Friday &apos;s protest followed a week of climate talks at the United Nations in New York , which included a sc@@ a@@ thing speech by Th@@ un@@ ber@@ g@@ to world leaders re@@ pri@@ man@@ ding them for inaction .
&quot; You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words , &quot; she said on Tuesday . &quot; The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us , I say we will never forgive you . &quot;
Ci@@ ting a U.@@ N.@@ -@@ backed re@@ port@@ released last year , demonstrators are demanding governments implement measures to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees , which scientists warn result in dire consequences for human life and the planet .
Th@@ un@@ berg and the young people she has inspired say they will not stop their weekly classroom walk@@ outs until they see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change .
In Nigeria &apos;s capital Abuja , Ol@@ ad@@ os@@ u Ad@@ en@@ i@@ ke marked her 46th consecutive strike on Friday . The activist posted images on Twitter of students dressed in blue school uniforms carrying ban@@ ners with messages , &quot; Climate change is real &quot; and &quot; We don &apos;t have time . &quot;
In La@@ us@@ anne , Switzerland , where hundreds of climate strike organizers ga@@ there@@ din August planning for this week &apos;s events , thousands of people marched through the city , according to local reports .
Thousands more were expected to take to the streets of Helsinki , Finland , where local media repor@@ ted@@ that the city &apos;s school would allow students to participate .
Th@@ un@@ berg , who remains in North America following her visit to the U.N. , was scheduled to participate in climate strikes in Montreal , Canada .
Se@@ rena Williams F@@ ined $ 10,000 For Alle@@ gedly Dam@@ aging W@@ im@@ bl@@ ed@@ on Court
Se@@ rena Williams , tennis legend and seven@@ -time W@@ im@@ bl@@ ed@@ on champion , is being fined $ 10,000 for allegedly damaging the London practice courts with her rac@@ quet .
The All England Club , which hosts the W@@ im@@ bl@@ ed@@ on tournament , handed the fine to Williams after she reportedly caused damage during a practice round on the outside courts on June 30 , according to The Associated Press and CNN .
The 3@@ 7-@@ year-old tennis star appeared to shru@@ g off the fine while speaking to reporters after winning the quarter@@ final round against Al@@ ison Ris@@ ke on Tuesday .
&quot; I haven &apos;t really thought about it , to be honest , &quot; she said when asked about the fine . &quot; I just threw my rac@@ quet . I got fined . &quot;
Williams said she didn &apos;t know how that could &apos;ve caused damage .
&quot; I mean , I guess if you could tell me , I would appreciate it , &quot; she told reporters . &quot; I mean , I have always been an A@@ ven@@ ger in my heart . Maybe I &apos;m super strong . I don &apos;t know . &quot;
Williams is after her eighth W@@ im@@ bl@@ ed@@ on title , which would be her 24th grand sla@@ m victory . She is advancing to the singles semi@@ finals on Thursday against Czech player Bar@@ bor@@ a Str@@ ý@@ co@@ v@@ á .
Williams was also fined a total of $ 17,000 last year after she defended herself against an um@@ p@@ ire at the U.S. Open who accused her of illegally communicating with her coach during a match .
During that incident , the um@@ p@@ ire issued three code violations to Williams : One for receiving illegal coaching , a second for breaking her tennis rac@@ ket in frustration and a third after she confronted the um@@ p@@ ire and called him a &quot; thief . &quot;
Many of Williams &quot; fans claimed that the um@@ p@@ ire was unnecessarily harsh in his response to her , especially considering male players &quot; mel@@ t@@ downs throughout the history of the sport .
&quot; Do you know how many other men do things that are much worse than that ? &quot; Williams told U.S. Open officials who entered the court during the match after her confrontation with the um@@ p@@ ire .
Williams wasn &apos;t the only one who received a fine at this year &apos;s W@@ im@@ bl@@ ed@@ on , though hers was the most costly .
Italian player Fab@@ io F@@ ogn@@ ini was fined $ 3,000 for saying a &quot; bomb should explo@@ de &quot; at the tennis courts after he lost the third round to U.S. player Tenn@@ ys Sand@@ gre@@ n on Saturday .
Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os of Australia was hit with two fines ― one for $ 3,000 and a second for $ 5,000 ― for un@@ sport@@ s@@ man@@ like conduct .
The Who ST@@ OP concert last night : Friday and Sunday shows CA@@ N@@ CE@@ L@@ LED
Rock legen@@ ds The Who are on a major US tour . In Houston , Texas , Roger Dal@@ tre@@ y was forced to call off the concert less than halfway through . The 7@@ 5-@@ year-old told the disappointed audience : &quot; I think I should quit while I &apos;m ahead . &quot; The band had performed eight songs already but promised to try and return for another show one day in the future . Watch the video of how it all un@@ folded on stage .
After playing classic 1982 track E@@ min@@ ence Front , Dal@@ tre@@ y called it qu@@ it@@ s. he has struggled with vocal issues and apparently is under strict instructions from his surgeon .
The British star told the crowd he couldn &apos;t go on with the show : &quot; If I carry on trying to do what I &apos;m doing for you , I &apos;m going to damage myself . I think I should quit while I &apos;m ahead ... Last time , I ended up in hospital for a month and I &apos;m not going there again . Sorry . &quot;
Pe@@ te Tow@@ n@@ sh@@ end explained what was going on to the audience : &quot; It sounds like he cannot do any more , I &apos;m afraid ... &quot;
The band left the stage , originally suggesting they would try to work out the rest of the set without Roger .
When he returned , Tow@@ n@@ send said : &quot; I &apos;m really , really sorry . Roger cannot actually speak now .
&quot; Apparently , before the show , he saw a doctor , and you know , he &apos;s been singing so f * * * ing great through this tour . I don &apos;t know what the f * * * is going on . He has been on top of his game .
&quot; I &apos;m really sorry this has happened to you guys tonight ... I don &apos;t think there is much point trying to put anything together that makes any sense because this is Roger &apos;s show and he &apos;s not in good shape . &quot;
The crowd was completely supportive , che@@ ering the 7@@ 4-@@ year-old as he explained what had happened and how the band hoped to return to honour their commitment to the show .
Tow@@ n@@ send said ; &quot; We will publish a date for our return as soon as we can . Let me explain one thing ... We only do one day on , one day off . This is because Roger &apos;s vocal surgeon insists he has a day off ...
&quot; I swear to you we will come back and we will honour your tickets . I love you so much and I &apos;m sorry to let you down . &quot;
Following the show , the upcoming Friday and Sunday night concerts in Dallas and Denver were cancelled .
Their next show is on October 9 in San Francisco . The band will open their UK tour in Manchester n March 16 , 2020 .

Are hopes for a nuclear-@@ free world realistic ?
Seven@@ ty-@@ four years ago , two nuclear bombs were detonated over Hiroshima and N@@ agas@@ aki , killing tens of thousands of people .
Since then , wherever conflict between major powers rises , so does the threat of a nuclear war .
Various treaties have attempted to suppress that threat , yet today there are nearly 14,000 nuclear weapons based around the world .
Thursday marks the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons , but it &apos;s a goal that looks increasingly less likely .
So , is there the political will to abolish these weapons ?
Me@@ gh@@ an to &apos; fulfil her heart &apos;s desires &apos; and refuses let own needs &apos; fade away &apos; amid her royal duties
Me@@ gh@@ an Mar@@ kle is determined to &apos; fulfil her heart &apos;s desires &apos; and not let her own needs &apos; fade away &apos; now she &apos;s a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls .
The Du@@ chess of Sus@@ sex , 38 , reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Wood@@ stock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry .
Wood@@ stock Exchange , the U@@ K-@@ SA Tech Hu@@ b , focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs , particularly women , to acquire skills , resources and support .
The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress , 38 , meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology , conservation and fashion and praise them for &apos; empowering the next generation &apos; of creative minds .
During a conversation with the female tech founders Me@@ gh@@ an , who has campa@@ igned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls , said she hopes to do the same for young men .
Mo@@ ther@@ -of-@@ two Na@@ adi@@ ya Moo@@ sa@@ je@@ e , a South African engineer , social entrepreneur and co-@@ founder of Women in Engineering , revealed : &apos; We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well , &apos; People reports .
&apos;@@ We both have sons , and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons , but generally in public too . &apos; 
She added that having Me@@ gh@@ an present &apos; didn &apos;t feel hierarchical &apos; , as it was &apos; women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have , as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies &apos; .
Mat@@ si Mo@@ dise , founder of skills training company Sim@@ o@@ dis@@ a , said Me@@ gh@@ an is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the F@@ old .
&apos;@@ She talked about being a mother and having duties as a du@@ chess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can &apos;t just fade away now that you &apos;re a du@@ chess , &apos; Mo@@ dise recalled .
&apos;@@ That you have to be true to who you are . &apos; 
She said the du@@ chess pushed them to pl@@ ough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward , knowing they are doing it for others who will follow .
&apos;@@ She wasn &apos;t referring to being a royal , but life in general when you have challenges , &apos; Mo@@ dise added , admitting she felt a bit &apos; a@@ we@@ struck &apos; by Me@@ gh@@ an .
&apos;@@ She radi@@ ates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace , &apos; Mo@@ dise said .
&apos;@@ A lot of us have done amazing things as founders , but meeting a royal is quite daunting . She made it easy . She is an eas@@ y-@@ going royal . &apos; 
Me@@ gh@@ an also revealed she &apos;s enjoying the pressures of being a working mother , admitting she finds ju@@ ggling being a royal and looking after baby Arch@@ ie &apos; a lot &apos; but &apos; all so exciting &apos; .
Speaking to mother@@ -of-@@ two Lar@@ a Ro@@ smar@@ in , CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology , Me@@ gh@@ an said : &apos; We &apos;re only five months in right now . Being a working m@@ um and travelling as well with a baby , my goodness it &apos;s a lot , but it &apos;s all so exciting .
&apos;@@ There are days when it &apos;s a lot to ju@@ ggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say &quot; ah@@ -@@ ha , &quot; and it &apos;s so rewarding . &apos; 
Me@@ gh@@ an then went to the city &apos;s Mo@@ ther@@ s@@ 2@@ Mothers organisation , which trains and employs women with HIV .
She took along some of Arch@@ ie &apos;s baby clothes , including a one@@ sie saying &apos; The Future &apos; and his In@@ vic@@ tus bab@@ y@@ gr@@ o which he no longer fits , alongside donations from her friends with children .
Parents of 5-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old stuffed in suit@@ case and to@@ ssed in dum@@ p@@ ster get 6 years in prison
The parents of a 5 ½ -@@ mon@@ th-@@ old boy whose body was thrown in a dum@@ p@@ ster were sentenced to six years in prison after ple@@ ading no contest Thursday to charges in the baby &apos;s death .
Adam Mans@@ on , 34 , and Ki@@ ana Williams , 32 , each pleaded no contest to one fel@@ ony count of child abuse resulting in death and admitted to a special allegation that they caused the death of their son , Jac@@ sun Mans@@ on , the Los Angeles County district attorney announced .
Mans@@ on and Williams had initially pleaded not guilty to the charges .
The two had been doing drugs in a South L.@@ A. mot@@ el on New Year &apos;s Eve when they found the baby dead , prosecutors said . They placed his body in a suit@@ case and to@@ ssed it in a trash bin near the Bal@@ d@@ win Hills C@@ ren@@ sha@@ w Plaza , prosecutors said .
In late April , weeks after searching through the El S@@ ob@@ ran@@ te Land@@ fill in Cor@@ ona , authorities called off the search . The child &apos;s body was never found .
Police said in a statement at the time that they made the decision to end the search for Jac@@ sun with a &quot; heavy heart , &quot; but noted they couldn &apos;t pin@@ point a location in the landfill &quot; to a point that would make continuing the search reasonable . &quot;
UK &apos;s medical drug supply still uncertain in no-@@ deal Brexit
Britain &apos;s government watch@@ dog says there is still a &quot; significant amount &quot; of work to do to ensure the country has an adequate supply of medical drugs in case of a no-@@ deal Brexit .
In a report issued Friday , Britain &apos;s National Audit Office said additional shipping capacity chartered by the U.@@ K. for sending goods across the English Channel might not be operational until the end of November - one month after the Oc@@ t. 31 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union . Of the more than 12,@@ 300 medicines licensed in the U.@@ K. , about 7,000 arrive from or via the EU , mostly across the Channel .
According to the British government &apos;s &quot; reasonable wor@@ st-@@ case &quot; scenario , the flow of goods could be cut by half on Day One of a no-@@ deal Brexit and could take a year to recover . It said time was &quot; extremely limited &quot; if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of October .
The report also said there was &quot; incomplete information &quot; about the levels of medicine stockpiling but that levels were increasingly daily . As of S@@ ept . 20 , suppliers reported that 72 % of medicines had a six-@@ week stockpile .
&quot; In the event of a no-@@ deal exit , the department ( of health ) would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hu@@ gely demanding task , &quot; the watch@@ dog wrote .
Me@@ g H@@ illi@@ er , who chairs a committee overseeing the audit office , called the findings &quot; deeply concerning . &quot; She said she had seen &quot; countless examples &quot; of the British government missing deadlines , but that this one was particularly striking .
&quot; If the government gets this wrong , it could have the gra@@ vest of consequences , &quot; she said .
Dr. Richard Tor@@ bet@@ t of the Association of the British Pharmaceu@@ tical Industry said that while companies have been working to prepare for Brexit , &quot; some things are outside of their control . &quot;
He said more details were needed on how companies might access government-@@ planned freight capacity if Britain sees a no-@@ deal departure from the EU .
&quot; Sec@@ uring a ( Brexit ) deal remains the best way to protect patients , &quot; he said .
Cleveland police branded &apos; failing &apos; in all areas by inspectors
Scan@@ d@@ al-@@ hit Cleveland police has become the first force to be branded &quot; failing &quot; in all areas by inspectors .
It has been rated inadequate overall and in three key areas by Her Majesty &apos;s Inspectorate of Con@@ st@@ abulary and Fire and Rescue Services ( H@@ MIC@@ F@@ RS ) , which scrutin@@ ised its ability to reduce crime and keep people safe , operate efficiently , as well as the way it treats the public and its workforce .
The findings mean the force is effectively plunged into special measures , where the chief con@@ stable and police and crime commissioner are called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure &quot; critical improvements &quot; are made .
The home secretary could then step in to tackle the problem if no progress is made .
A string of scand@@ als has plagued the force , covering Har@@ tle@@ pool , Red@@ car and Cleveland , Stock@@ ton and Midd@@ les@@ b@@ rough in the north east of England .
It has seen six chief con@@ stabl@@ es in almost as many years .
Former chief con@@ stable Se@@ an Price was s@@ acked for gross misconduct in 2012 ; seven officers were under investigation after journalists &quot; phones were unlawfully monitored , and there have been long-standing claims of racism within the ranks .
Work practices were recently described by the chief inspector of con@@ st@@ abulary as being about as &quot; inefficient as you can possibly imagine , &quot; with officers having to share lap@@ tops and body@@ worn cameras .
H@@ M Inspector of Con@@ st@@ abulary Phil Gor@@ m@@ ley said it was a &quot; failing force &quot; where there had been &quot; significant &quot; deterioration in the last two years .
Te@@ es Valley mayor Ben Hou@@ chen said the report described the &quot; worst findings ever into any police force in the country &quot; which was &quot; finally the official validation &quot; that the force is &quot; broken &quot; and said the Home Office needed to intervene now .
He added : &quot; It &apos;s no longer in dispute . It is a fact described in black and white in this report .
&quot; The findings are some of the most di@@ stressing and shocking I have ever read . &quot;
Cleveland is one of 15 forces that has been recently inspected by H@@ MIC@@ F@@ RS inspectors , and the only one rated inadequate in all areas .
Gor@@ m@@ ley added : &quot; The force doesn &apos;t appropriately pri@@ ori@@ tise crime prevention . There is a lack of strategic direction , and the force doesn &apos;t allocate enough resources to prevention work ... It is failing to respond appropriately to vulnerable people , including children . It is missing opportunities to safeguard them and exposing them to risk . &quot;
He said senior leaders were not consistently demonstrating &quot; ethical behaviour , &quot; and the &quot; inappropriate behaviour of senior leaders within Cleveland is so profound that it is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force . &quot;
He added : &quot; It doesn &apos;t consistently treat its workforce with fairness and respect and it doesn &apos;t effectively communicate with or engage its workforce ; its processes aren &apos;t perceived to be fair and it doesn &apos;t understand its workforce well enough to support them . &quot;
Despite the findings , the force did receive a small amount of praise for the way it tack@@ les serious and organised crime but was told it must improve the way it investigates crimes .
The force &apos;s police and crime commissioner Barry Cop@@ p@@ inger said : &quot; I am deeply concerned at the worrying contents of this report .
&quot; The force &apos;s recent performance is simply not good enough . &quot;
He said he had received assurances from the current chief con@@ stable Richard Lewis that &quot; swift action &quot; was taken as soon as he became aware of the fail@@ ings .
Cop@@ p@@ inger has been ordered by the Home Office to respond to the report within 56 days .
Lewis said the report would act &quot; as a line in the sand &quot; for the force , adding : &quot; Improvements have already been made and I take full responsibility for driving through the changes that are so obviously needed . In the five months I &apos;ve been here I have met some exceptional police officers and staff , at all levels , and have seen lives saved and vulnerable people protected by the efforts and determination of front@@ line officers . &quot;
If drastic improvements are not made quickly enough , the Government could step in , as it can when prisons are failing .
But so far politicians have never had to resort to this measure with police forces , inspectors said .
K@@ it Mal@@ thouse , minister for crime , policing and fire , said he welcomed the chief con@@ stable &apos;s &quot; swift action to address these fail@@ ings and will be monitoring the position closely , &quot; adding : &quot; Transparency and accountability are vital for public trust in policing .
Im@@ manuel Christian School : Six@@ th-@@ grade boys accused of p@@ inning down black girl and cutting off her dread@@ locks in Virginia
A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of p@@ inning her down and cutting off her dread@@ locks . The incident took place at Im@@ manuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike P@@ ence &apos;s wife , Karen P@@ ence , is a teacher .
Amar@@ i Allen , a 12-@@ year-old student at the private K-@@ 12 Christian school , said the boys called her dread@@ locks &quot; ugly &quot; and &quot; n@@ app@@ y &quot; before cutting them off on the playground during rec@@ ess .
&quot; They kept laughing and calling me names , &quot; Amar@@ i told CBS affiliate W@@ USA@@ -@@ TV , te@@ aring up . &quot; They called me &apos; ugly , &apos; said , &apos; I shouldn &apos;t have been born . &apos; They called me &apos; an atten@@ tion-@@ seeker . &apos; &quot;
According to W@@ USA , one of the boys allegedly covered Amar@@ i &apos;s mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of sc@@ iss@@ ors to her dread@@ locks .
Amar@@ i didn &apos;t tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed .
&quot; They ran off laughing , and I was just sitting there , &quot; Amar@@ i said .
The alleged incident occurred on Monday , but the shy pre@@ teen said she didn &apos;t tell her family about it until Wednesday , after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different . She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth , she said .
&quot; It &apos;s very painful , &quot; said Cy@@ n@@ th@@ ia Allen , Amar@@ i &apos;s grandmother . &quot; I want to see them dismissed from the school . I want to see something done . &quot;
Allen &apos;s family pays nearly $ 12,000 per year for Amar@@ i to attend the school , which made headlines earlier this year after Karen P@@ ence took an art teaching job at the fam@@ ously anti-@@ L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q institution .
&quot; We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students , and have a zero-@@ tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse , &quot; Im@@ manuel Christian School said in a statement . &quot; We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made , and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can . We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation , and further inquiries should be directed to the Fair@@ fax County Police . &quot;
While the school has a zero-@@ tolerance policy for bullying , Amar@@ i said the boys had previously tor@@ mented her . She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past .
Amar@@ i &apos;s family met with school officials Thursday , and the investigation is ongoing .
Iran releases British oil tan@@ ker St@@ ena Im@@ per@@ o
Iran released a Bri@@ ti@@ sh@@ -@@ flag@@ ged oil tan@@ ker on Friday , two months after it captured the vessel for allegedly entering its waters in violation of international law .
Iranian Por@@ ts and Maritime Administration confirmed that the vessel , St@@ ena Im@@ per@@ o , left Band@@ ar Abbas port at 9 a.m. , the state-@@ run IR@@ NA reported .
Eri@@ k Han@@ ell , president and CEO of St@@ ena Bul@@ k , the operator of the ship , also confirmed the ship &apos;s release .
&quot; St@@ ena Bul@@ k and Northern Marine Management confirm the St@@ ena Im@@ per@@ o and its crew have been released , &quot; he said via Twitter .
The ship was captured by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps on July 19 for having violated international maritime law when it allegedly ve@@ ered into Iranian waters in the Strait of Hor@@ mu@@ z .
The vessel &apos;s seizure , however , was widely seen as retali@@ atory for British forces capturing a tan@@ ker off Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions . The ship was released in mid-@@ August despite the Trump administration making a la@@ st-@@ ditch attempt to length its detention .
The St@@ ena Im@@ per@@ o was officially given permission to leave on Monday but was kept in port until a probe into the ship &apos;s conduct completed , the New York Times reported .
&quot; The vessel has left the port of Band@@ ar Abbas and is transi@@ ting to Dubai for the crew to dis@@ embark and receive medical checks and deb@@ ri@@ efing , &quot; Han@@ ell said . &quot; The families of crew members have been informed and the Company is currently making arrangements for the repatriation of its valued seaf@@ arers at the earliest possible opportunity . &quot;
The ship became victim to escalating tensions near the Persian Gulf where both the United States and Iran shot down the other &apos;s dr@@ one and at least two tan@@ kers were sabot@@ aged by explosives , which the Trump administration has blamed Iran for .
The Trump administration most recently blamed Iran for dr@@ one attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities , which Tehran denies having any involvement with .

Uganda : Government Laun@@ ches Oral HIV Self-@@ Test K@@ it
Ministry of Health has launched an oral HIV self-@@ test kit aimed at empowering citizens , especially men to carry out HIV testing .
The initiative is aimed at reducing new HIV / A@@ ids infections by 2020 .
The oral HIV test kit dubbed , O@@ ra@@ Quick HIV self-@@ test , a product of O@@ ra@@ sure technologies , targets young people aged 18 to 24 years , men and priority populations such as sex workers .
&quot; Currently we are targeting young people 18 to 24 years . For the young people that &apos;s the age bracket we are looking at but of course any one above 18 and it &apos;s because we do not have evidence of children by the Constitution but as more evidence un@@ folds we are going to get there . For the men , we give the kit to the mother and they take it to the partner , key and priority populations such sex workers , &quot; Mr Ge@@ off@@ rey Tas@@ i , the technical offic@@ er-in-@@ charge of HIV testing services , said yesterday .
Easy use
Initially , the self-@@ test kits available involve the use of blood to detect the HIV , however , with oral HIV self-@@ test kit , oral fluids are involved .
The test works by detecting anti@@ bodies , the body &apos;s natural defenders against infection . If one is infected with HIV , these anti@@ bodies will be present in your blood and also in the sali@@ via . The test will detect the anti@@ bodies in the mouth .
Data by the Uganda A@@ ids Commission ( U@@ AC ) shows that Uganda is registering 1,000 new HIV / A@@ ids infections and 500 deaths from the viral disease per week , translating into 5@@ 3,000 new infections and 2@@ 3,000 deaths annually .
Dr Diana A@@ tw@@ ine , the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health , said this is timely and will enhance the fight against HIV / A@@ ids .
She , however , urged the men to take HIV testing as an important issue .
She added that there is still effort to reach the 14 per cent of the people , who are living with HIV but do not know their HIV status .
&quot; Currently , 86 per cent people living with HIV know their status ; that means it leave us with 14 per cent of those living with HIV and do not know their status . So how do we now util@@ ise that additional innovation . Really for me this is it ... how do we now move from this kit and create demand , especially for that 14 per cent that are sick and they need care and they are not getting care , &quot; Dr A@@ tw@@ ine said .
However , health officials warn one should not eat or drink within 15 minutes before starting the test .
Mr Tas@@ i said studies conducted showed no suicide cases and the ministry is confident that the potential of harm can be avoided because the test is voluntary .
Dr A@@ tw@@ ine said apart from graphics and videos provided to educate the users , there should be toll free numbers always available to offer counselling in both government and private facilities , including all pharmac@@ ies .
Research . According to the research , O@@ ra@@ Quick HIV self-@@ test detected more than 99 per cent of people , who were infected with HIV and people , who were not infected with HIV .
Ath@@ letes feeling the heat at Qatar world championships
Some competitors at the world athle@@ tics championships that began on Friday have already encountered their most challenging opponent : the swel@@ tering Qatari heat .
With its suff@@ oc@@ ating humidity and daytime temperatures h@@ over@@ ing around 38 degrees Cel@@ sius , Doha weather has been widely discussed among athletes and athle@@ tics officials and seen as a cause for concern in some events .
Those competing on the road in the marathon and walking races will begin their events in the middle of the night to minimize the heat &apos;s harmful effects .
Although the heat is less of a threat to the athletes competing inside the Khalifa International Stadium , where temperatures are kept at around 21 degrees with the help of a cooling system , they have still had to adjust their training because they practise at an outdoor facility .
&quot; We are from a hot climate as well , but nothing to compare with this , &quot; Baham@@ ian coach Ronald Car@@ tw@@ right told Reuters .
&quot; Here you walk outside and it &apos;s like somebody put a heater on you . I guess that is why they are doing it at night . &quot;
Athle@@ tics officials have pledged additional medical and safety measures for marathon runners and race wal@@ kers .
The IA@@ AF , the global governing body of athle@@ tics , said the women &apos;s marathon , scheduled to start at midnight on Friday , would go ahead as planned as temperatures would be at or below 30 degrees .
It said its medical delegate had assured athletes that weather conditions would be monitored all day and reported to the teams &quot; to ensure the event is run at an acceptable level of health risk . &quot;
Track athletes competing inside the stadium said it was unlikely that the heat would significantly affect their performances , but conce@@ ded that practices have been especially dra@@ ining .
&quot; At practice I &apos;m g@@ lowing because I &apos;m swe@@ ating because it &apos;s so humid , &quot; said R@@ ai Benjamin , who compe@@ tes in the 40@@ 0@@ m hurdles .
&quot; It &apos;s like I got out of the shower . But I don &apos;t think it will be that bad because of the cooling system . &quot;
S@@ hot pu@@ tter Ryan Cro@@ user , the 2016 Olympic champion , said he has had to heat up his shots to around 38 degrees Cel@@ sius to prevent them from becoming wet during practices in the siz@@ z@@ ling heat and high humidity .
&quot; The shot is far below the dew point , the instant you take it out , it &apos;s just so@@ aking wet and it &apos;s dri@@ pping water , &quot; the American said . &quot; It &apos;s worse than if it was pouring down rain ... We &apos;ve been fighting this a little bit . &quot;
European pole va@@ ult champion Arm@@ and Du@@ plan@@ tis , who trains in the heat of the southern U.S. state of Louisiana , said the humidity can prove helpful in practice because the addition of moisture to the chal@@ k on his hands &quot; makes for a really nice grip . &quot;
But other pole va@@ ul@@ ters who spray a stic@@ ky grip enhan@@ cer on their hands might have more difficulty holding onto their poles in the humidity , he said .
&quot; For people who use stic@@ ky spray , I can see it being a problem because it can get a little s@@ lim@@ y and goo@@ ey , &quot; Du@@ plan@@ tis said .
F@@ ears of security breach at major prison as lock@@ smith is arrested
A prison lock@@ smith has been arrested amid fears keys to a jail &apos;s cells have been copied resulting in taxpayers footing a £ 500,000 bill to replace all its locks .
H@@ MP W@@ and@@ s@@ worth called in police amid fears that dupl@@ icates had been sold to some of its 1,400 inmates .
The suspected security breach will result in 3,000 locks replaced , potentially to cell , internal and outer doors .
Police arrested a 40-@@ year-old man at the jail on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office on September 13 . The man , from South West London , was working for the Government Facility Services Ltd , which maintains 52 j@@ ails across the south of the country .
The police investigation has raised concerns that im@@ prints of some of the keys may have been taken in clay before actual copies were produced .
However , prison bosses stressed that they had not found any evidence that inmates had obtained any keys .
W@@ and@@ s@@ worth Prison is a Category B jail in South West London which can house up to 1,6@@ 28 prisoners , making it one of the largest prisons in Western Europe . The jail , built in 18@@ 51 , holds convicted male criminals and those on remand awaiting trial .
A Prison Service spokeswoman said : &quot; H@@ MP W@@ and@@ s@@ worth has increased security at the gate and is operating extra identity checks as a result of a security incident . It would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing . &quot;
House chairmen warn Trump to stop attacking whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower
&quot; The President &apos;s comments today constitute re@@ prehen@@ sible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress &apos; impe@@ achment inquiry . We condemn the President &apos;s attacks , and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower , and all whist@@ le@@ blow@@ ers , &quot; they said . &quot; Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower process , with grave consequences for our democracy and national security . &quot;
The statement said Trump &quot; is fully aware that our Committees are seeking testimony from this whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower and others referenced in the whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower &apos;s complaint released today as part of the House &apos;s impe@@ achment inquiry , and our nation &apos;s laws prohibit efforts to discourage , intim@@ idate , or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress . &quot;
&quot; No officials with knowledge relevant to the committees &apos; investigation , including knowledge of the subject of the whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower complaint , may be subject to any intimidation , reprisal , or threat of reprisal , and all witnesses must be made available for congressional testimony , &quot; they added .
The statement on Thursday comes amid@@ st an explosive week in Washington rooted in a whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower complaint alleging that Trump abused his official powers &quot; to solicit interference &quot; from Ukrainian President V@@ olo@@ dy@@ my@@ r Zel@@ en@@ sky in the upcoming 2020 election , and the White House took steps to cover it up . A transcript of July phone conversation released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zel@@ en@@ sky to investigate former Vice President Joe Bi@@ den and his son , Hunter .
There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Bi@@ den .
Even before the whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower complaint was made available to lawmakers , House Speaker Nancy Pel@@ os@@ i on Tuesday declared Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impe@@ achment inquiry into the President .
Michelle Obama Calls Me@@ gh@@ an Mar@@ kle &apos; An Inspir@@ ation &apos; In Ad@@ oring In@@ stag@@ ram
Michelle Obama gave high praise to Me@@ gh@@ an Mar@@ kle in a sweet In@@ stag@@ ram on Thursday , calling the Du@@ chess of Sus@@ sex &quot; a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it . &quot;
The du@@ chess and Prince Harry , now on a 10-@@ day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Arch@@ ie Har@@ rison Moun@@ t@@ b@@ atten@@ -@@ Wind@@ sor , attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders .
&quot; Thank you to my friend , Her Royal Highness The Du@@ chess of Sus@@ sex @ su@@ s@@ sex@@ royal , a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it , &quot; the former first lady wrote in her g@@ lowing post .
&quot; Whether meeting with our @ Ob@@ am@@ a@@ Foundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve , she is an inspiration to so many , &quot; Obama added , alongside a photo of a smiling Me@@ gh@@ an posing with foundation leaders .
Me@@ gh@@ an interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vo@@ gue , which the former &quot; Su@@ its &quot; actress gu@@ est-@@ edited . In their can@@ did chat , the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it &apos;s changed her .
&quot; Being a mother has been a master@@ class in letting go , &quot; Obama said in the interview .
&quot; Mo@@ therhood has taught me that , most of the time , my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be . Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age , but who they are , deep inside . &quot;
Obama , who knows first-hand the pressure of being under a global spot@@ light , dol@@ ed out some advice to the du@@ chess in an interview with Good House@@ keeping .
&quot; The pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot , &quot; she said . &quot; So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don &apos;t be in a hurry to do anything . &quot;
She continued :
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters , making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work . I think it &apos;s okay - it &apos;s good , even - to do that .
Mom@@ ent hero police officer r@@ ushes onto busy motor@@ way to save dog hit by car
This is the heroic moment a police officer ran out onto a busy motor@@ way to rescue an injured dog .
Foot@@ age from Joseph Pu@@ gli@@ a &apos;s d@@ ash@@ c@@ am shows him jumping out of his police car within seconds of seeing the dog get hit by another vehicle .
The officer , who works in Pin@@ ell@@ as Park , Florida , wrapped the wounded pu@@ p in an emergency blanket , placed him in his SU@@ V rushed to the nearest animal hospital .
&quot; My heart really sank until I started seeing him breathing , &quot; Mr Pu@@ gli@@ a told ABC news .
Than@@ k@@ fully , the dog survived with just minor cuts and bru@@ ises .
&quot; We nick@@ named him &quot; L@@ ucky &quot; and I think the name applies , &quot; the officer said . &quot; He &apos;s definitely one lucky dog . &quot;
The dog was brought to a local animal shelter and his rescu@@ er has since been hailed as a hero .
But Mr Pu@@ gli@@ a insists he was just doing his job .
The officer added that if animal services cannot find the owner , some of his family members would be more than willing to give L@@ ucky a home .
After We@@ Work deb@@ acle , IPO market s@@ lam@@ s bra@@ kes on un@@ profitable companies
BO@@ ST@@ ON ( Reuters ) - Companies making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough welcome , especially if they are losing money , casting a shadow over the calendar for initial public offerings for the rest of the year .
The surprise postponement of the We@@ Work IPO has underscored how confidence is ero@@ ding in the market both for companies looking to raise capital and investors .
A more discer@@ ning market for initial public offerings continued to punish Pel@@ ot@@ on Interactive Inc P@@ TO@@ N.@@ O on Friday , a day after it began trading , as shares of the fitness star@@ tup fell 4 % to $ 24.@@ 74 . The company is now trading 15 % below its Wednesday IPO price .
In the past , public market investors have typically expected companies to become profitable within 18 months or so of an IPO . This timeline has been relaxed with money managers eager to add businesses with fast-@@ growing revenue to their portfolios .
Recent deals , however , suggest an uncertain economic outlook is pushing investors to be more selective about the los@@ s-@@ making companies they are willing to back .
Pel@@ ot@@ on reported rapid top-@@ line growth of 110 % during the fiscal year that ended June 30 . But the company also showed negative operating leverage , with operating expenses sur@@ ging 147 % over the prior year .
L@@ os@@ s-@@ making te@@ eth@@ -@@ alignment company S@@ mile@@ Direc@@ t@@ Club SD@@ C.@@ O earlier this month became the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first trading day , according to research firm Renaissance Capital .
The average IPO return in 2019 is now about 9 % , down from more than 30 % at the end of June and more than 18 % about two weeks ago .
In the United States , much of the attention in the third quarter has focused on a deal that failed to come to fru@@ ition - the planned IPO of We@@ Work parent We Company .
Having aimed to launch its IPO earlier in September , the company postponed plans to list until later in 2019 , before replacing its chief executive officer and saying it was reviewing its timetable to go public .
En@@ de@@ av@@ or Group Holdings ( ED@@ R.@@ N ) , an entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power broker Ar@@ i E@@ manuel with a track record of losses , made a la@@ st-@@ minute decision to abandon its IPO due to the tough market conditions . Taking a lesson from the struggles earlier in 2019 of ri@@ de-@@ ha@@ iling companies U@@ ber Technologies ( UB@@ ER@@ .@@ N ) and Ly@@ ft Inc ( L@@ Y@@ FT@@ .@@ O ) , which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable , investors have started to push back on companies with a history of steep losses . &quot; It will be a dialogue among bankers and boards and senior management teams where they say , &quot; these were isolated and not comparable , &quot; or say &quot; we have a sentiment shift and we need to be more conservative and use a different strategy , &quot; &quot; said David Eth@@ ridge , U.S. IPO services leader at audit firm P@@ w@@ C . The market was more recep@@ tive to les@@ ser@@ -@@ known names such as cyber security company Ping Identity P@@ IN@@ G.@@ N and cloud monitoring company Dat@@ ad@@ o@@ g Inc DD@@ O@@ G.@@ O. Both companies have reported more modest losses and rely on selling to companies rather than to consumers .
Jonathan Van N@@ ess Just Hun@@ g Out With Nancy Pel@@ os@@ i And They &apos;ve Got A Plan
&quot; Que@@ er Eye &quot; star Jonathan Van N@@ ess stru@@ t@@ ted his stuff on Capit@@ ol Hill on Thursday , joining forces with House Speaker Nancy Pel@@ os@@ i ( D-@@ Cal@@ if . ) to discuss the Equality Act .
The Equality Act would extend nondiscrimination protections to L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q individuals in credit , education , employment , housing , federal financial assistance , jury service and public accommodations .
The bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of already protected classes .
Van N@@ ess , who recently publicly came out as HIV positive , first shared a video of himself cat@@ -@@ walking in the Capit@@ ol , explaining in his cap@@ tion that he &apos;d met with the House speaker to talk Equality Act , living with HIV and access to Pr@@ EP ( an HIV preventative medication ) :
He then shared a longer post pic@@ turing the two of them arm in arm , urging his followers to stand up to Senate Maj@@ ority Leader Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell ( R-@@ K@@ y . ) and apply pressure to GO@@ P senators to bring the Equality Act up for a Senate vote :
Pel@@ os@@ i introduced the Equality Act on March 13 . The House passed the legislation in May . It has not yet been brought to the Senate floor .
In August , the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to essentially leg@@ alize anti-@@ gay discrimination in the workplace , arguing in an am@@ ic@@ us brief that the federal laws on employer discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were not intended to protect individuals from being fired based on their sexual orientation .
Pel@@ os@@ i met earlier this year with Van N@@ ess and three of his &quot; Que@@ er Eye &quot; co-@@ stars as well as Rep@@ . Alexan@@ dria O@@ ca@@ si@@ o-@@ Cor@@ te@@ z ( D-@@ N.@@ Y@@ . ) , to talk policy and promote the bill .
On Thursday , Pel@@ os@@ i shared her own image of herself and Van N@@ ess warmly holding hands on a balcon@@ y , thanking him for bringing his voice to the fight :
David Atten@@ borough working on new documentary about animals and colour
David Atten@@ borough is 9@@ 3-@@ year@@ s-@@ old but the ic@@ onic nature g@@ uru is not slowing down just yet .
No , after the success of his ground@@ breaking Net@@ fli@@ x documentary Our Planet , the much loved star is set to return with another series : Life In Col@@ our .
This time , the father@@ -of-@@ two will look at how animals use colour in their lives through high-tech cameras that were built especially for the programme .
The BBC have revealed that the star aims to show &quot; a world of colour normally invisible to human eyes &quot; - and it sounds truly fascinating .
However , despite fans being eager for the upcoming release , it seems we all need to sit tight as it won &apos;t be dropping on our screens until 20@@ 21 .
But we &apos;re sure it &apos;ll be worth the wait .
Earlier this month , David was presented with the TV Choice Life@@ time Achievement Award , at the prestigious ceremony in London .
The national treasure has enter@@ tained millions over his career , which has so far span@@ ned 60 years .
When collecting his g@@ ong , the reporter en@@ th@@ used : &quot; Indeed . What I do isn &apos;t always enter@@ taining , and sometimes people hear things they don &apos;t like !
&quot; But this is an honour and a great pleasure . &quot;
TV Choice said of the winner : &quot; Still working , learning and making programmes Sir David Atten@@ borough isn &apos;t just a British hero , he &apos;s a global icon . &quot;
This week , David was celebrated once again as a polar research ship was named after him .
The star joined both Prince William and Kate for the naming ceremony in Cam@@ m@@ ell L@@ air@@ d ship@@ yard in Bir@@ ken@@ head , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side .
He said : &quot; It &apos;s no news to any of you that the world is facing great , great problems and the most aware of that are the young people of today , who will inherit this world .
&quot; Great problems require great research and facts in order to solve them .
&quot; That &apos;s what this aston@@ ishing ship will be here to do , to find out the facts and find the science with which to deal with problems that are facing the world today and will increasingly do so tomorrow . &quot;
Life In Col@@ our is expected to air on BBC Two in 20@@ 21 , while it &apos;s said Net@@ fli@@ x will retain global rights .
Don &apos;t use my wife &apos;s name to score points , says husband of murdered MP J@@ o Co@@ x
The husband of J@@ o Co@@ x said his wife &apos;s name must not be used to score political points after Jere@@ my Cor@@ by@@ n last night posted footage of the murdered MP to critic@@ ise Bor@@ is Johnson .
The Labour leader &apos;s film featured cli@@ ps of Mrs Co@@ x and a vi@@ gi@@ l held after her death , with the cap@@ tion : &quot; Bor@@ is Johnson does not care about violence on our streets . &quot;
Critics said Mr Cor@@ by@@ n was using her murder to score &quot; cheap political points &quot; while her husband Bren@@ dan Co@@ x said the Labour leader was &quot; wrong &quot; to inf@@ er hat@@ eful language was a &quot; simple party political issue . &quot;
Mr Co@@ x said : &quot; Jere@@ my is right that the best way to honour J@@ o is to defeat hatred and division . He &apos;s also right the PM has a particular responsibility .
&quot; But he &apos;s wrong to inf@@ er this is a simple party political issue . J@@ o was p@@ assion@@ ately Labour but some things must trans@@ cend party politics . &quot;
He also shared a post which said J@@ o Co@@ x &apos;s name was &quot; more than a political scoring point &quot; with the cap@@ tion &quot; This . Thank you . &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n was facing a back@@ lash for his video which opens with him talking about Mrs Co@@ x &apos;s murder three years ago by a far-@@ Right activist in her West Yor@@ kshire constituency .
Speaking over a mon@@ tage of cli@@ ps of Mrs Co@@ x , Mr Johnson and female MPs , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said : &quot; This Prime Minister knows these words can promote violence and have real consequences . He wants division . Clearly , he doesn &apos;t care about the violence on our streets . &quot;
He goes on to critic@@ ise Mr Johnson and call for a Labour government .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n added : &quot; Many are deeply concerned about the language used by Bor@@ is Johnson , language which is being repeated by the far-@@ Right . When this was raised with him by women MPs , who themselves face death threats , he ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ tly dismissed them . It was nothing short of dis@@ graceful . &quot; Former Labour MP John Wood@@ cock shared the video and said : &quot; You can really shut up . Dis@@ g@@ usting . &quot;
Meanwhile T@@ ory MP and business minister Nad@@ him Za@@ ha@@ wi said : &quot; You are so wrong to use J@@ o Co@@ x in this way , when her family have specifically asked for her not to be used in this way . To be kept out of politics .
&quot; If you have an ounce of dec@@ ency Jere@@ my Cor@@ by@@ n you would take this video down . &quot; It follows a row over language in Parliament this week in which Mr Johnson said that the &quot; best way &quot; to honour Mrs Co@@ x was to &quot; get Brexit done . &quot; Her sister Kim Lead@@ be@@ ater called for a di@@ alling down of extreme language saying it was &quot; not helpful to J@@ o &apos;s kids . &quot;
She told IT@@ V : &quot; For me to come out and say ou@@ trage@@ ous things about Bor@@ is Johnson - I just don &apos;t think that &apos;s a useful way of moving forward . I can say what I think is right and what I think is wrong but I &apos;m going to try and do that in a measured manner . &quot;
The daughter of Labour MP Y@@ vet@@ te Cooper spoke out yesterday to say she constantly fears for her mother &apos;s life because of the way people speak about politicians .
House rebu@@ kes Trump on border wall , but he plans veto
The Democ@@ rati@@ c-@@ controlled House is making a second attempt to over@@ turn President Donald Trump &apos;s use of emergency powers to raid military base projects such as schools and target ranges to pay for his long-@@ promised border fence .
The 23@@ 6-@@ 174 vote sent the legislation to Trump , who is sure to veto it just as he killed a similar measure in March .
The Senate passed the measure last week with about a dozen veteran Republican lawmakers rebu@@ king Trump .
Friday &apos;s vote was different because it followed the recent release by the administration of a list of 127 military construction projects tot@@ aling $ 3.6 billion that will be canceled to pay for the border wall , including numerous projects in GO@@ P districts and states .
Brazil says oil in spill along northeast beaches not Brazilian
Brazil &apos;s environmental agency I@@ b@@ ama said on Thursday that an analysis of a vast oil spill along the country &apos;s northeastern beaches showed the sp@@ illed crude did not originate in the country .
I@@ b@@ ama said in a statement that it had been investigating the spill in several beaches in some northeastern states since S@@ ept . 2 . Local media showed pictures of sea tur@@ tles coated in black tar by the s@@ lick .
The spill spans over 1,500 kilometers ( 9@@ 32 miles ) of Brazil &apos;s northeast coast , affecting wildlife and polluting some of the post@@ card beaches in one of the nation &apos;s top tour@@ istic destinations , such as Pra@@ ia do Fu@@ tur@@ o , in the state of C@@ ear@@ a , and Mar@@ ago@@ gi , in Al@@ ago@@ as state .
Brazil &apos;s state-@@ controlled oil company Petro@@ le@@ o Brasi@@ le@@ iro SA said in a statement that it had concluded after a molecular analysis of the oil that the crude sp@@ illed was not produced nor sold by the company .
Cr@@ ude oil is tested before export to make sure it complies with the standards of the refinery it is being shipped to . Cr@@ ude oil from different fields can be identified according to a series of chemical signatures , including levels of sulfur and nitrogen , ac@@ idity and viscosity .
The head of Brazil &apos;s oil agency AN@@ P Dec@@ io Od@@ done said the agency believes the oil could have been sp@@ illed by a tan@@ ker transporting the crude far from the Brazilian coast , but added this possibility has not yet been confirmed yet . An AN@@ P statement said there were no reports of sp@@ ills by any operator of oil drilling ri@@ gs in the country .
Some marine tur@@ tles were contaminated by the oil . They were rescued alive in the state of Rio Grande do Nor@@ te and sent to rehabilitation centers . Other animals were found dead , I@@ b@@ ama said , without disclo@@ sing species or numbers .
Petro@@ br@@ as , as the state oil company is known , said in a statement that even though it was not involved in the spill it was contributing to the clean-up efforts , with some 100 Petro@@ br@@ as employees helping clean the beaches .
S@@ ko@@ da to provide drivers with voice activated digital assistant
S@@ ko@@ da is to introduce a digital assistant that can be activated with a verbal command . In an announcement Wednesday , the Czech car maker said the digital assistant could be activated by the phrase &quot; Okay , Laura . &quot;
The system , which supports six languages , is able to undertake a range of tasks including starting navigation to a destination and searching for music . It will initially be available in models of the K@@ ami@@ q city SU@@ V and the compact Scal@@ a . Part of the Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ agen Group since 1991 , the S@@ ko@@ da brand delivered 1.@@ 25 million vehicles globally in 2018 , according to its annual report .
The company &apos;s introduction of a virtual , voice activated assistant mirrors efforts by other manufacturers in the sector . Some B@@ MW cars , for instance , are now equipped with an &quot; intelligent personal assistant &quot; which can be activated by using a button , a personal activation word or the phrase &quot; Hello , B@@ MW . &quot; Ver@@ bal commands can be used to , among other things , activate seat heating , get information on tire pressure , and adjust the in-@@ car temperature .
&quot; Voice is the ideal interaction tool in the vehicle , &quot; Jack Pal@@ mer , a senior connected car specialist at SB@@ D Autom@@ otive , said in a statement sent to CN@@ BC via email on Thursday .
&quot; If the lion &apos;s share of commands from the driver can be in@@ pu@@ t@@ ted through virtual assistants , rather than fid@@ dling around with tou@@ ch@@ screens and buttons , the current epidemic of driver distr@@ action will be greatly mitigated , &quot; Pal@@ mer added . &quot; Autom@@ akers have realized this and the race is on for them to integrate their own solutions or partner with consumer electronics companies such as Google and Amazon . &quot;
The moves by firms such as S@@ ko@@ da and B@@ MW point to a potential shift in the way people interact with their cars . Hann@@ ah K@@ es@@ his@@ hi@@ an , an automotive analyst at market intelligence firm M@@ inte@@ l , told CN@@ BC via email that one of its recent reports had highlighted how nearly 40 % of U.S. consumers who owned a vehicle &quot; would like to use a digital personal assistant in their vehicle . &quot; This , she added , &quot; opens the door to greater possibilities for digital assistant vehicle connectivity . &quot;
Ghana : World Rab@@ ies Day Ob@@ served
The 13th World Rab@@ ies Day was marked in Accra on Wednesday with a call on pet owners to vacc@@ inate their dogs in order to safeguard the lives of the citiz@@ en@@ ry .
The programme which was held under the theme &quot; Rab@@ ies : Vacc@@ inate to eliminate &quot; was organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture Veter@@ inary Service .
It was aimed at highlighting the essential role of mass can@@ ine vaccination in rab@@ ies elimination in the country .
Addressing the conference , the Assistant Director General and FAO Representative to Ghana , Mr A@@ be@@ be H@@ ail@@ e-@@ Gabriel indicated that the issue of rab@@ ies could be minim@@ ised if efforts were geared towards vaccination and keeping stra@@ y animals away from humans especially children .
According to him , the &apos; Zero by 30 &apos; Global Strategic Plan &quot; of the 500,000 people who died from rab@@ ies each year , 40 per cent are children living in Asia and Africa , &quot; and called for holistic approach to deal with the situation to save kids from rab@@ ies .
Mr H@@ ail@@ e-@@ Gabriel stated that most stra@@ y animals carried rab@@ ies and re-@@ echoed the need for the country to supplement the United against Rab@@ ies 2030 strategy that requires the pet owners to vacc@@ inate animals that carried zo@@ on@@ otic diseases .
He underscored the need for the country to embark on five-year campaign and vaccination programme to create awareness to eliminate potential exposure of human to rab@@ ies .
A comprehensive road@@ map for progressive elimination of rab@@ ies , he noted had been rolled out through the Ghana Rab@@ ies and Prevention Action Plan ( 201@@ 8-@@ 2030 ) to end epidemics of neglected tropical diseases by 2030 .
Mr H@@ ail@@ e-@@ Gabriel pledged the readiness of the FAO to collaborate with other stakeholders in preventing and controlling rab@@ ies in the country .
Dr Owen K@@ alu@@ wa , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) Representative to Ghana observed that rab@@ ies was an endemic which had to be controlled to save lives .
He explained that through the &quot; Zero human rab@@ ies deaths by 2030 &quot; strategy , countries were supported to develop and implement their national rab@@ ies elimination plans that embrace the One Health Concept and cross sectoral collaboration .
Dr K@@ alu@@ wa noted that 99 per cent of zo@@ on@@ otic disease like rab@@ ies was transmitted from dogs to humans , adding that One Health approach to controlling and ultimately eliminating human rab@@ ies was expedi@@ ent .
Director of Veter@@ inary Service , Dr Asi@@ ed@@ u Ba@@ ah la@@ mented that rab@@ ies had become global burden .
&quot; Though rab@@ ies has no cure , the infection is vaccine preventable , hence its elimination is feasible therefore any animal owner must ensure their animals are vacc@@ inated , &quot; he stated .
Dr Ba@@ ah said although rab@@ ies was fully preventable using appropriate sustainable control strategies , lack of funds and concerted efforts had continued to result in escalation of human death and the spread of the endemic .
&quot; It is imperative that the animal sector is adequately resourced to prevent transmission of rab@@ ies in dogs as a protective measure against the disease , &quot; he added .
The 12-@@ year-old who &quot; sil@@ enced the world &quot;
G@@ ret@@ a Th@@ un@@ berg has established herself as the planet &apos;s spokeswoman on climate change at the tender age of 16 . But long before social media , another teenager was s@@ col@@ ding UN leaders on the world stage 27 years ago .
In the year since she organized school walk@@ outs in her native Sweden to protest climate change , G@@ ret@@ a Th@@ un@@ berg &apos;s environmental crus@@ ade has been unavoidable , culminating on Monday in an angry and passionate speech before the UN &apos;s Climate Action Summit , in which she lam@@ ba@@ sted politicians for stealing her &quot; dreams &quot; and her &quot; childhood &quot; with &quot; empty words &quot; while humanity sta@@ res down &quot; a mass extinction . &quot;
Th@@ un@@ berg &apos;s grim pronoun@@ cements have earned her sav@@ age criticism , and g@@ lowing praise . New York Magazine called her &quot; the Joan of Ar@@ c of climate change , &quot; while The Guardian ranked her speech alongside President Lincoln &apos;s G@@ et@@ ty@@ sburg Address for its historical significance .
Then again , they said the same about Sever@@ n Cul@@ lis@@ -@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki in 1992 . Long before Th@@ un@@ berg dead@@ pan@@ ned to parliamentarians that &quot; we probably don &apos;t even have a future any more , &quot; and ne@@ tiz@@ ens tore each other to sh@@ re@@ ds attacking and defending her , 12-@@ year-old Cul@@ lis@@ -@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki became known as the &quot; The girl who sil@@ enced the world for five minutes &quot; when she delivered a similar ser@@ mon before the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro .
The tone of Cul@@ lis@@ -@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki &apos;s speech is stri@@ kingly similar to Th@@ un@@ berg &apos;s . &quot; We &apos;ve come ... to tell you adults that you must change your ways , &quot; she opened , just like Th@@ un@@ berg told the assembled adults &quot; we will not let you get away with this . &quot;
Just as Th@@ un@@ berg told the UN summit &quot; we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money and fair@@ y@@ tales of eternal economic growth , &quot; Cul@@ lis@@ -@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki told leaders that &quot; losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market . &quot;
And underpinning both girls &quot; messages was a ni@@ hil@@ istic fat@@ alism . &quot; I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the hole in our ozone . I am afraid to breathe the air because I don &apos;t know what chemicals are in it , &quot; Cul@@ lis@@ -@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki said in 1992 . Stri@@ king schoolchildren in 2019 carry ban@@ ners reading &quot; You &apos;ll die of old age , I &apos;ll die of climate change . &quot;
The environmental problems addressed by Cul@@ lis@@ -@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki reflect the world of the early 1990s , when deforestation , the depletion of the ozone layer , and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de j@@ our . Yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the intervening years . Thanks to a landmark chemicals ban , ozone depletion has slowed dramatically , and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined .
Cul@@ lis@@ -@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki herself went on to found an environmental think tank and work for UN Secretary General Kofi Annan &apos;s Special Advisory Panel in the early 2000s .
So what does the future have in store for Th@@ un@@ berg ? Well that depends how you look at Cul@@ lis@@ -@@ Su@@ zu@@ ki &apos;s example . On one hand , none of her worst fears came to pass . On the other , world governments still have ecological problems to contend with , and are still being lec@@ tured by children about them .
As@@ suming the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now - as Th@@ un@@ berg says it won &apos;t unless we s@@ lash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so - then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long UN and NGO career that kicked off with one famous speech .
By then , another concerned child will likely be delivering a passionate warning about acid rain in the Mar@@ tian colonies .
SN@@ P could support Jere@@ my Cor@@ by@@ n as temporary PM to stop no-@@ deal Brexit
The SN@@ P has sign@@ alled it could support installing Jere@@ my Cor@@ by@@ n in Dow@@ ning Street on a temporary basis to th@@ wart a no-@@ deal Brexit .
As tensions between MPs and Dow@@ ning Street deepened , Nic@@ ola St@@ ur@@ geon suggested it could row in behind the Labour leader as a care@@ taker prime minister until a general election .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n called on rebel T@@ ories and opposition MPs to back him to lead a temporary administration in August - but the move was met with resistance , particularly from the Liberal Democrat leader J@@ o S@@ win@@ son .
Under the proposals , opposition parties would seek to ou@@ st Bor@@ is Johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the UK cra@@ shing out of the EU on 31 October .
The plan failed to gain cross-@@ party support at the time , but senior figures in the SN@@ P are concerned that Mr Johnson could de@@ fy a law forcing him to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 October .
Nic@@ ola St@@ ur@@ geon , the SN@@ P leader , suggested that Mr Cor@@ by@@ n could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving Mr Johnson in charge would be a &quot; terrible idea . &quot;
Responding to a t@@ we@@ et suggesting installing the Labour leader or another temporary prime minister , she said : &quot; Ag@@ ree with this .
&quot; V@@ ote of no confidence , opposition un@@ ites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension , and then immediate general election .
&quot; Nothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me . &quot;
Veter@@ an MPs H@@ arri@@ et Har@@ man and Ken Clar@@ ke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior SN@@ P source insisted it had to be the Labour leader .
&quot; It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence , so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election , &quot; the source told IT@@ V &apos;s Robert Pe@@ ston .
&quot; Tr@@ ying to find a compromise candidate , a national unity candidate , is too complicated , especially in the time we have . Whether people like it or not , the temporary prime minister has to be Cor@@ by@@ n . &quot;
An SN@@ P spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no-@@ deal Brexit and removing &quot; this dangerous and un@@ democratic prime minister as soon as possible . &quot;
The spokesperson said : &quot; It is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Bor@@ is Johnson and his c@@ ron@@ ies , who are determined to find a way to get around the Ben@@ n Act , but is instead sent by a temporary care@@ taker prime minister , who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter , with an election held immediately afterwards .
&quot; We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-@@ deal Brexit and getting rid of Bor@@ is Johnson . &quot;
Even with SN@@ P support , it would come down to a kni@@ fe@@ -@@ edge vote for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n . There are 288 T@@ ory MPs , as well as 10 Democratic Uni@@ on@@ ists , so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent MPs to come on board .
Labour argued that the plan was the &quot; simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal . &quot;
However the Liberal Democrats believe a temporary government led by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n cannot achieve the necessary support across the House , as he would need the backing of ex-@@ T@@ ory MPs and defec@@ tors from his own party .
Kir@@ st@@ ene H@@ air , T@@ ory MP for Angu@@ s , said : &quot; This report confirms what many have long suspected - SN@@ P MPs will happily pro@@ p up Jere@@ my Cor@@ by@@ n in No@@ 10 .
&quot; There is no doubt that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s weak stance on in@@ dy@@ ref@@ 2 is a deciding factor for the nation@@ alists .
&quot; He has already left the door open for a re-@@ run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister .
&quot; Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted &quot; No &quot; in what was meant to be a once in a generation event . &quot;
Over 50 Sur@@ rey University students banned from sports teams amid accusations of sexual harassment
&quot; People are just doing everything you would expect from a l@@ ads holiday . It is accepted that this is an alcohol heavy , ra@@ uc@@ ous trip . &quot;
However , students said that this year behaviour of some students went too far , particularly during a game which involved members of the football club being dared by their team@@ mates to make advances on women , while their friends attempt to &quot; inter@@ cept &quot; them .
Alan Su@@ ther@@ land , chief executive of Sur@@ rey &apos;s student unions said : &quot; We became aware of the misconduct , and as investigations proceeded any individual students who were accused of committing a &quot; major &quot; offence as per the student disciplinary regulations were referred to a university investigation . &quot;
Three students were formally disciplined by the university , which launched its own investigation into the football team &apos;s conduct .
One student was expelled for three counts of sexual misconduct or harassment , and one count of aggressive behaviour .
Meanwhile two other students , who were also accused of harassment , were issued with final warnings and made to issue apo@@ logies .
One was banned from University premises at certain times and the other was banned from attending organised social events . All three students were banned from attending their graduation ceremonies .
The Sur@@ rey University men &apos;s football club said that they &quot; sincerely apolog@@ ise &quot; for its members actions during the Croatia tour .
Matt de Gro@@ od shouldn &apos;t be punished because of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia stigma
In 2016 , Matthew de Gro@@ od , the man who killed five people at a house party in C@@ alg@@ ary , was found to be not crimin@@ ally responsible for his actions .
Now , in 2019 , there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms , such as un@@ supervised ou@@ tings . The decision won &apos;t come for a few more weeks , so in the meantime we &apos;re left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea . There are two sides to this : one citing his violent behaviour in the past , calling to prevent it from happening again , and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation .
First , let &apos;s examine the more pes@@ si@@ mistic side . De Gro@@ od did sta@@ b and kill five people during a psycho@@ tic break . It was a violent and unpredictable attack . He suffers from sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia , which is why he was found not crimin@@ ally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiat@@ rist and taking his medication . His psychiat@@ rist , Dr. San@@ to@@ ch R@@ ai , has said in front of the review board that &quot; if Matthew de Gro@@ od were to commit another offence , it would be severe . &quot; Despite his perceived improvement , there is still risk of re-@@ offense . But is this reason enough to remain afraid ? Is it enough to keep de Gro@@ od locked up ?
As long as de Gro@@ od continues to take his medication , there isn &apos;t a huge risk of re@@ offense , so why are people so concerned ? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness , particularly those with sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia , largely influences this fear . Certain mental illnesses have become less stigm@@ atized , such as mood and anxiety disorders . But others , including sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia , remain highly stigm@@ atized . This is in large part due to numerous portra@@ y@@ als of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people .
That was the case in this situation , but these instances are rare , and that &apos;s perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur . In fact , the majority of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic individuals are non@@ violent , and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence . In light of this , it seems unreasonable to insist that de Gro@@ od be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-@@ offense is based more on a prejudic@@ ed attitude towards people with sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia than actual likelihood .
I don &apos;t believe de Gro@@ od should ever be un@@ supervised permanently . A par@@ ol@@ e-@@ like system where he has to check in to make sure he &apos;s still taking his medication could work well . Ar@@ guing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation . It perpetu@@ ates the idea that mentally ill people , those with sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia in particular , cannot ever mesh with society ; thus continuing the stigma and perpetu@@ ating the idea that they are dangerous criminals . He was found not crimin@@ ally responsible by a court of law , so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better ?
Hungarian PM Or@@ ban def@@ ends his candidate for EU executive , &quot; has solutions in pocket &quot;
Prime Minister Vi@@ k@@ tor Or@@ ban has said he has several solutions &quot; in his pocket &quot; after Hungary &apos;s candidate for the European Commission was rejected .
The EU transport commission@@ er-@@ designate , Romanian socialist politician Ro@@ v@@ ana Pl@@ um@@ b , and the proposed commissioner for EU enlargement , former Hungarian justice minister Las@@ z@@ lo T@@ roc@@ san@@ yi , were told their confirmation hearings could not go ahead because of inconsistencies in their financial statements , Reuters reported .
&quot; I am convinced that &#91; T@@ roc@@ san@@ yi &#93; is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the European Commission , &quot; Or@@ ban said . &quot; His sin was that he helped the government and me ... to protect Hungary from migration . &quot;
The move is seen as an embarrassment for Or@@ ban , who proposed T@@ roc@@ san@@ yi , and who has been in constant conflict with Brussels over his migration policy and other issues .
Bab@@ ies on a plane : Japan Airlines unve@@ ils tool to tackle horror of scre@@ aming infants
Being stuck on a long-@@ haul flight within ear@@ shot of a crying baby could be a thing of the past for passengers on Japan Airlines ( J@@ AL ) , after the carrier unveiled an online booking tool that indicates where to@@ dd@@ lers will be seated .
When passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat , a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan , aler@@ ting other passengers who have yet to select their seats .
J@@ AL was quick to point out that the new feature did not guarantee that passengers would be out of ear@@ shot of a scre@@ aming infant .
The icon would not appear if passengers booked their flight through a third party or were part of a tour group , or if there was a la@@ st-@@ minute change of aircraft , the airline &apos;s website said .
J@@ AL and other airlines have yet to come up with way of anticip@@ ating seat reservations by serial sno@@ rers and passengers who fully re@@ cl@@ ine their seats during in-@@ flight meals .
But the move attracted praise from some social media users .
&quot; Thank you , @ J@@ AL _ Official _ j@@ p for warnings me about where babies plan to scre@@ am and y@@ ell during a 13 hour trip , &quot; Ra@@ hat Ahmed , a businessman , t@@ wee@@ ted . &quot; This really ought to be mandatory across the board . &quot;
Others , though , cas@@ ti@@ gated travellers for intolerance towards fellow passengers .
&quot; They are babies , as we all once were . We need to learn tolerance or will soon start needing a map of seat locations for mouth brea@@ thers , dro@@ ol@@ ers , far@@ ters , drun@@ ks , and perhaps a lot more things in life , &quot; one user said .
Pom@@ pe@@ o acc@@ uses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attack
Secretary of State Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , speaking on the sidel@@ ines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday , said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year .
Pom@@ pe@@ o said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bas@@ har Assad &apos;s government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Id@@ li@@ b province on May 19 .
&quot; The Assad regime is responsible for in@@ num@@ erable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , &quot; Pom@@ pe@@ o told a news conference .
U.S. officials in May said they &apos;d received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time .
In April 2018 , the U.S. , Britain and France launched air@@ strikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month .
&quot; This is different in some sense because it was chlorine ... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons , &quot; Pom@@ pe@@ o said .
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $ 4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chem@@ ic@@ al-@@ weapons use .
Pom@@ pe@@ o also called on the Assad government to release thousands of un@@ justly detained prisoners , including American journalist Austin T@@ ice , who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years .
&quot; He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all . &quot;
Tes@@ la jum@@ ps on report Mus@@ k aims to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter
El@@ on Mus@@ k , co-@@ founder and chief executive officer of Tes@@ la Mot@@ ors .
Sha@@ res of Tes@@ la jumped more than 5 % after Elec@@ tre@@ k , an electric vehicle news website , reported that CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k said the company &quot; has a shot &quot; at delivering 100,000 cars this quarter , which would be a new record .
Elec@@ tre@@ k attributed the update to a lea@@ ked email from Mus@@ k sent to his employees at Tes@@ la . Mus@@ k wrote in the email : &quot; We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter , which is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company ! &quot;
The CEO also reportedly added , &quot; The challenge is making sure that we have the right car variants in the right locations and r@@ all@@ ying as much as our company resources as possible to help with the end of the quarter deliveries . &quot;
The autom@@ aker is expected to report its quarterly vehicle deliveries in the next few days .
Last quarter , Tes@@ la delivered approximately 9@@ 5,000 electric vehicles .
Greece : 5 deny poor women &apos;s babies sold in illegal adop@@ tions
Five Greek and Georgian citizens have appeared in court on charges of belonging to a criminal organization that allegedly sold babies for adoption .
All five denied the charges before a Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ki magistrate on Friday . The two Georgian nationals are accused of being the ring@@ leaders .
The gang allegedly recruited pregnant Bulgarian women who were desti@@ tu@@ te and willing to give up new@@ bor@@ ns they might deliver . Authorities say the group sold babies to child@@ less Greek couples .
A total 12 people were arrested this week in connection with the alleged illegal adop@@ tions and the alleged sale of human eggs . Another 54 have been charged with complicity .
Police say it was one of the biggest and best-@@ organized gangs of its kind in Europe . The continent &apos;s Euro@@ pol police agency assisted the investigation .
Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o says Syrian government used chlorine in May chemical weapon attack
Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , the US Secretary of State , said on Thursday that the United States had concluded the Syrian government had used chlorine as a chemical weapon in an attack in May during a battle with insurgents in Id@@ li@@ b .
&quot; The Assad regime is responsible for in@@ num@@ erable atrocities , some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , &quot; Mr Pom@@ pe@@ o told a news conference in New York , where he has been attending the United Nations General Assembly .
&quot; Today I am announcing that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chlorine as a chemical weapon on May 19 , &quot; Mr Pom@@ pe@@ o added .
The United States said in May it had received numerous reports that appeared consistent with chemical exposure after an attack by the forces of Bas@@ har al-@@ Assad , the Syrian president , in nor@@ thwestern Syria , but it had made no definitive conclusion as to whether they used chemical weapons .
The Trump administration has twice bombed Syria over Assad &apos;s suspected use of chemical weapons , in April 2017 and April 2018 .
Father Rem@@ ains Hop@@ eful That Sus@@ pec@@ t Who Fat@@ ally S@@ hot Son One Year A@@ go Will Be Cau@@ ght
It &apos;s been one year since a 20-@@ year-old from Long Beach was fat@@ ally shot , but the victim &apos;s family isn &apos;t giving up hope that the sho@@ oter will be caught .
&quot; I wish I could trade places with you son , I wish I could trade places with you , &quot; Guy Al@@ ford , the victim &apos;s father , said .
Al@@ ford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son , Guy Al@@ ford III , was gun@@ ned down at a Jack In The Box near 5@@ 2nd and Atlantic . He said he wanted to call attention to his son &apos;s un@@ solved murder .
&quot; Some@@ body knows something , they need to say something , &quot; he said .
Security video , which has never been released , showed Al@@ ford stopped in the dri@@ ve-@@ thr@@ u when a second car pulled up behind him . Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car . One of them walked up to the driver &apos;s side , and shot Al@@ ford . The four people in Al@@ ford &apos;s car jumped out and ran . The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away .
&quot; Wherever this co@@ ward is , he will get caught , &quot; Al@@ ford said .
This gri@@ eving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son , and he said he still didn &apos;t know who was in the car with him when he was shot .
&quot; They up@@ ped and ran out of my son &apos;s car like that , where did you run to , &quot; Al@@ ford said . &quot; Did you go back and try to help him or what ? Nobody said nothing . &quot;
Al@@ ford said his son was a star football player at Al@@ em@@ any High School , then a stand-@@ out safety on the Long Beach City College football team . Al@@ ford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse .
&quot; He was working three jobs , &quot; Michael Harvey , a friend , said . &quot; As somebody who &apos;s 21 , he was a year younger than me , anybody with that type of hu@@ stle and work eth@@ ic , you tend to look up to . &quot;
As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues , Al@@ ford said he wasn &apos;t giving up either .
&quot; I can assure you , this one is going to get solved , &quot; he said .
Al@@ ford is personally offering a $ 2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction . Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police .
Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here
Hum@@ iliation in the courts at home is a taste of what awa@@ its Johnson in Brussels if he tries to we@@ as@@ el out of his commitments to request an extension . That will comfort European officials , who would most probably agree to it . Main@@ ly because taking more time to find a solution reduces the threat of a no-@@ deal Brexit , which would be economically harmful to both sides .
Yet European diplomats can also see that the political bed@@ lam in the UK l@@ ends itself to delay without decisions . Law@@ makers in Parliament were able to set aside their differences to tie Johnson &apos;s hands and seek an extension , but that &apos;s about all they can agree on . This is the same Parliament that rejected the former prime minister The@@ resa May &apos;s hard-@@ fought Brexit deal with the EU three times . Unless there &apos;s an election - another decision on which MPs have a final say - that won &apos;t change .
But even an election is a grim prospect for European capitals hoping for a friendly resolution to the Brexit mess . The opposition Labour Party &apos;s Brexit policy is a painful cont@@ or@@ tion act that &apos;s almost impossible to understand ; the centr@@ ist Liberal Democrats &apos; idea to cancel Brexit altogether is seen as extreme . The longer this dra@@ gs on , the more it eats away at the smooth functioning of the EU .
There might be more optimism in Brussels if the outline of a workable deal was already sitting on a desk somewhere in the European Commission &apos;s Ber@@ lay@@ mont headquarters . But there isn &apos;t .
Johnson &apos;s regular b@@ ashing of his predecessor &apos;s &quot; back@@ stop &quot; proposal to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland and protect the EU single market hasn &apos;t led to any convincing alternatives . Officials say the proposals sent in by the UK on alternative arrangements aren &apos;t concrete enough to be considered operational in time for an October 31 exit .
And Johnson &apos;s weakness will give the 27 leaders facing him even less incentive to erase crucial red lines , despite the claim by Michael Go@@ ve , the UK minister in charge of a no-@@ deal Brexit , that they &apos;re &quot; shifting &quot; on the back@@ stop .
In an ideal world , a series of blows landing on Johnson - who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit - would bring the match closer to an end . Europe should still try to extract maximum concessions from the UK , given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states - which is going to get harder the longer this dra@@ gs on . If there &apos;s a window to try yet again to put a deal before the UK parliament , the EU should grab it .
But this is more like a soccer match with 27 players on one side lining up to defend while the player in the opposite team tries to pick up the ball and go home .
The EU is good at setting rules and red lines and sticking to them ; it &apos;s less good at unilaterally imposing its will . The UK is hem@@ med in by its own internal contradictions , at least until an election or a second referendum breaks the impasse .
Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here .
Black hole sw@@ allowing and ri@@ pping apart star captured for first time
A gi@@ gan@@ tic black hole has been captured pulling in and ri@@ pping apart a star for the first time .
The star , which was about the same size as our sun , was seen from 375 million light years away war@@ ping and spir@@ alling into the gravitational pull of a super@@ massive black hole , researchers said in the A@@ stro@@ physical Journal .
It was then suc@@ ked into obli@@ vi@@ on in a rare cosmic occurrence astronomers call a tidal disruption event .
NASA &apos;s plan@@ et-@@ searching telescope , the Transi@@ ting Ex@@ o@@ planet Survey Satellite - T@@ ESS - captured the detailed timeline from beginning to end for the first time .
Astronom@@ ers used a worldwide network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon before looking at T@@ ESS , whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant planets , caught the beginning of the violent event .
Thomas H@@ olo@@ i@@ en , an astronomer for the Carnegie Institution for Science who led the research , said : &quot; This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky , and sometimes that &apos;s what you need to push the science forward . &quot;
Stars get suc@@ ked in when they venture too close to a super@@ massive black hole , which lives at the centre of most galaxies , including the Earth &apos;s Mil@@ ky Way .
The black hole &apos;s impressive gravitational forces tear the star apart , with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole , forming a disc of hot , bright gas as it is sw@@ allowed .
Mr H@@ olo@@ i@@ en added : &quot; Specifically , we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brigh@@ tening , and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique . &quot;
UK business committee to probe Thomas Cook collapse
The UK &apos;s Civil Aviation Authority said today that 72 flights are scheduled to operate to bring back a further 16,000 people to the country following the collapse of travel group Thomas Cook .
The aviation regulator said it has brought back over 40 % of the total number of passengers in the largest peace@@ time repatriation &apos; Operation Mat@@ ter@@ horn &apos; launched on Monday .
Meanwhile , the British parliament &apos;s business committee has launched an inquiry into the collapse of Thomas Cook and will seek to question the management over issues such as executive pay and accounting practices .
Thomas Cook , the world &apos;s oldest tour operator , collapsed in the early hours of Monday , hitting hotel owners , tourist sites and resor@@ ts around the world .
&quot; The main players in the sad demise of Britain &apos;s oldest travel firm should face public scrutiny and be held to account for their actions before the company collapsed , &quot; said Rachel Re@@ eves , Chair of the Business , Energy and Industrial Strategy ( BE@@ IS ) Committee .
Evidence hearings will begin in mid-@@ to-@@ late October .
&quot; Directors will welcome the opportunity to set the record straight and demonstrate that their conduct was always in the best interests of Thomas Cook &apos;s customers , employees and stakeholders , &quot; a person familiar with the company told Reuters .
Why The Times Published Details of the Whi@@ st@@ le-@@ B@@ lower &apos;s Identity
On Thursday , The Times published exclusive details about the identity of the whist@@ le-@@ bl@@ ower whose claims led Democrats to begin an impe@@ achment inquiry against President Trump this week . ( The article reported that the whist@@ le-@@ bl@@ ower is a C.@@ I.@@ A. officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine . )
Many readers , including some who work in national security and intelligence , have criticized The Times &apos;s decision to publish the details , saying it potentially put the person &apos;s life in danger and may have a chilling effect on w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be whist@@ le-@@ blow@@ ers .
We took their concerns to Dean Ba@@ quet , The Times &apos;s executive editor , who responded to them in a discussion with the Re@@ ader Center :
The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whist@@ le-@@ bl@@ ower , who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impe@@ achment proceeding . The president himself has called the whist@@ le-@@ bl@@ ower &apos;s account a &quot; political h@@ ack job . &quot;
We decided to publish limited information about the whist@@ le-@@ bl@@ ower - including the fact that he works for a non@@ political agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible .
China S@@ ays It Did@@ n &apos;t Fight Any War Nor Inv@@ aded Foreign Land
China on Friday said it has not provoked a &quot; single war or conflict &quot; or &quot; invaded a single square &quot; of foreign land , skir@@ ting any reference to the 1962 war with India .
&quot; China has always been dedicated to resolving territorial and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation , &quot; stated an official white paper released , four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70@@ th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) on October 1 .
&quot; China safeguards world peace through real actions . Over the past 70 years , China has not provoked a single war or conflict , nor invaded a single square of foreign land , &quot; the paper titled &quot; China and the World in the New E@@ ra &quot; said .
The white paper , while highlighting the CP@@ S &apos;s &quot; peaceful rise &quot; made no reference of the bloody 1962 war with India and the vast tracts of land , especially in the Ak@@ sai Ch@@ in area , occupied by China .
The Sino-@@ India border dispute involving 3,@@ 48@@ 8-@@ k@@ m-@@ long Line of Actual Control ( LAC ) remained unresolved . China also claims Ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al Pra@@ desh as part of South Tibet , which India contests .
So far , the two countries held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the border dispute .
Besides the 1962 war , India and China had a major military stan@@ do@@ ff at Do@@ k@@ lam in 2017 when the People &apos;s Liberation Army ( P@@ LA ) tried to lay a road close to India &quot; s narrow Ch@@ ick@@ en N@@ eck corridor connecting with the North-@@ Eastern states in an area also claimed by Bhutan .
It was finally diplom@@ atically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops .
China also had a major military conflict with Vietnam in 1979 . China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea . Vietnam , Malaysia , the Philippines , Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims .
&quot; China has achieved full resolution of land border delimitation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries , and deline@@ ated the China-@@ Vietnam maritime boundary in the Bei@@ bu Gulf , &quot; the white paper said , noting that since reform and opening up in 1978 , the country has cut its armed forces &quot; by over four million . &quot;
The two-@@ million strong Chinese military still remain the world &apos;s largest .
Pro@@ long@@ ed mon@@ soon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India
India &apos;s mon@@ soon season has over@@ run by almost a month , with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collap@@ sing buildings and many crops beginning to rot .
Normally the mon@@ soon in north India rec@@ edes by the beginning of September , but the average rainfall this month has been 37 % above normal . If the situation continues for the remaining few days , it will be the latest the mon@@ soon has ever rec@@ eded in decades , according to experts in the India Meteorological Department .
Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain , the latest being the town of P@@ une in western India , where tor@@ ren@@ tial rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings .
Hom@@ es were flooded and people w@@ aded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the mon@@ soon .
Other cities such as Kol@@ k@@ ata , Luc@@ know and Hy@@ der@@ abad have also experienced heavy rainfall . U@@ t@@ tar@@ ak@@ hand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains .
The mon@@ soon was also late to arrive . Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers brac@@ ed themselves for a possible drought .
The extended mon@@ soon is not welcome among farmers . &quot; This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year . It is making my vegetables - I &apos;ve got cab@@ bage , beans , pe@@ as and tomatoes at the moment - rot , &quot; said Pra@@ k@@ ash Meh@@ ra , a small farmer in B@@ him@@ tal in U@@ t@@ tar@@ ak@@ hand .
For consumers , the impact of the delayed and now late-@@ rec@@ eding mon@@ soon has meant a rise in the price in the price of on@@ ions , an essential ingredient in Indian food . O@@ ni@@ ons are selling at 80 ru@@ pe@@ es ( about £ 1 ) a kil@@ o in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai , as opposed to the normal 20 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 23@@ p ) .
F@@ esti@@ vals are also at risk . The next big festival is Dus@@ se@@ h@@ ra on 8 October , when Hindu@@ s erect giant , comic boo@@ k-@@ style eff@@ i@@ gies of R@@ av@@ ana , a figure from the Hindu epic The Ram@@ ay@@ ana who sports a bus@@ hy mou@@ stac@@ he and an evil gr@@ in .
Bur@@ ning R@@ av@@ ana symbol@@ ises the triumph of good over evil . But given that the eff@@ i@@ gies are made of paper , if the mon@@ soon continues , R@@ av@@ ana might have the last laugh .
Julian As@@ san@@ ge : Private security firm &apos; sp@@ ied on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder in Ecuadorian embassy for C@@ IA@@ &apos;
A Spanish private security company hired to protect the Ecuadorian embassy in London when Julian As@@ san@@ ge lived there sp@@ ied on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder for the US intelligence service , it has been claimed .
A report in Spanish newspaper El Pa@@ is said the company , U@@ C Global SL , allegedly handed over audio and video to the CIA of meetings As@@ san@@ ge held with his lawyers .
The company is being investigated over the claims by Spain &apos;s High Court , the Audi@@ en@@ cia Nacional , said the report .
As@@ san@@ ge filed a criminal complaint himself , in which he accused the company of violating his privacy and the secrecy of his cli@@ ent-@@ attorney privileges .
El Pa@@ is said U@@ C Global SL had failed to respond to requests for comment on the claims .
In April , As@@ san@@ ge was dragged out of the embassy after being handed over to the British authorities by Ecuador .
He took refuge there in 2012 while on bail and facing extradition to Sweden over sex assault allegations , saying he feared extradition to the US if he left over the activities of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
The US formally requested his extradition in June on 18 charges , including computer misuse and the un@@ authorised disclosure of national defence information .
He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Man@@ ning .
He is now in Bel@@ mar@@ sh prison in London after being j@@ ailed for violating bail conditions imposed over the Swedish extradition request and was due to be released last week , but was re@@ man@@ ded in custody pending a hearing of the US extradition case in London in February 2020 .
In May , Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation into an allegation of rape against As@@ san@@ ge - an allegation he has always denied .
Om@@ ni Air flight lands in Baltimore after declaring emergency
The Federal Aviation Administration says an Om@@ ni Air International jet landed safely at Baltimore Washington International Airport after declaring an emergency .
The FA@@ A said in an email that Flight 328 landed at B@@ W@@ I at 6 : 19 p.m. on Thursday because of what was described as a hydraulic problem with the Boeing B@@ 7@@ 77 .
According to the FA@@ A , the flight departed from Baltimore , but its destination wasn &apos;t known . It &apos;s unclear how many people were on board . The agency is investigating the incident .
A telephone message left at Tul@@ sa , Okla@@ hom@@ a-based Om@@ ni Air International was immediately returned Thursday night .
Why we still need Gandhi
The leaders of the world &apos;s two largest democracies need to heed the principles of a remarkable man whose 15@@ 0th birthday we are currently celebrating .
Mo@@ hand@@ as Kar@@ am@@ ch@@ and &quot; Ma@@ hat@@ ma &quot; Gandhi , who was born on Oc@@ t. 2 , 18@@ 69 , left a worldwide legacy with his focus on ethics , non@@ violence , tolerance and social justice . He had a profound impact on two of the most important mass mobil@@ izations in the United States .
The influence of Gandhi on the civil rights movement actually started well before the Rev@@ . Martin Luther King &apos;s embrace of his ideals , with African-@@ American activists such as Howard Th@@ ur@@ man and Benjamin M@@ ays undertaking long sea voy@@ ages to India to meet Gandhi .
And C@@ es@@ ar Cha@@ vez , who modeled many of his tactics on Gandhi &apos;s in leading the farm@@ workers &quot; movement , traced his political awak@@ ening to a news@@ re@@ el he watched at the age of 11 or 12 showing that &quot; this half-@@ naked man without a gun had conquered the might of the British Empire . &quot;
Outside the United States , Gandhi had a similar effect . Nelson Mandela , the Dalai Lama , Nobel Peace Pri@@ z@@ e-@@ winner Mal@@ ala Y@@ ous@@ af@@ zai and climate change activists , to give just a few examples , have acknowledged Gandhi as a guiding light .
But President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister N@@ aren@@ dra Mo@@ di , who triumph@@ antly addressed a joint mega@@ -@@ rally in Houston recently , seem to be imper@@ vious to Gandhi &apos;s ideas , despite paying lip service to him at the event . Both are right-wing popul@@ ists who have ruled with sc@@ ant compassion or tolerance , successfully mobilizing whites and Hindu@@ s in their respective countries as voting bloc@@ s , and f@@ omen@@ ting division and social antagon@@ ism .
Mo@@ di has belonged , since he was 8 years old , to a Hindu nationalist organization known as the R@@ SS , an ex-@@ member of which , N@@ ath@@ u@@ ram God@@ se , assassinated Gandhi on Jan@@ . 30 , 1948 . Indeed , parliamentarians from Mo@@ di &apos;s ruling B@@ har@@ ati@@ ya Jan@@ ata Party have he@@ ap@@ ed praise on Gandhi &apos;s killer in recent years .
The Mo@@ di government &apos;s un-@@ Gand@@ hi@@ an approach has manifested itself on many fronts . It has stripped the Muslim@@ -@@ majority province of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and statehood and put it into lock@@ down . It has proven un@@ welcoming to the mostly Muslim Ro@@ hing@@ ya refugees who have fled from extreme persecution in Myanmar .
And Mo@@ di &apos;s government has created an upro@@ ar by instituting a national registry of citizens and setting up detention camps in the border state of Ass@@ am to o@@ sten@@ sibly catch non@@ citizens from neighboring Muslim@@ -@@ majority Bangladesh , a step that may end up dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ising and imprison@@ ing almost 2 million people .
Trump is singing from a similar song@@ book . His administration &apos;s Muslim@@ -@@ majority travel ban echo@@ es the Islam@@ ophobia that often informs Mo@@ di &apos;s policymaking . Its call@@ ousness toward refugees mirrors the Indian government &apos;s dis@@ d@@ ain for the Ro@@ hing@@ ya population &apos;s suffering , and its detention camps parallel the ones the Mo@@ di regime is setting up . Trump &apos;s stir@@ ring of racial anim@@ osity is analogous to troubl@@ esome rhetoric from a number of Mo@@ di &apos;s cabinet members .
There was a te@@ ac@@ hable moment for the two leaders at their recent joint rally . House Maj@@ ority Leader St@@ en@@ y Ho@@ yer at the event quoted Gandhi &apos;s definition of democracy as &quot; something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong . &quot;
Trump and Mo@@ di would do very well to keep Gandhi &apos;s advice in mind , 150 years after his birth .
Trump nomin@@ ates Peter G@@ ay@@ nor to be FE@@ MA chief : White House
Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FE@@ MA ) Acting Administrator Peter G@@ ay@@ nor smiles as he testi@@ fies before a Senate Appropri@@ ations Hom@@ eland Security Subcommittee hearing on FE@@ MA &apos;s F@@ Y@@ 2020 budget request on Capit@@ ol Hill in Washington , U.S. , April 3 , 2019 .
U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter G@@ ay@@ nor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FE@@ MA ) , the White House said in a statement .
G@@ ay@@ nor , FE@@ MA &apos;s deputy administrator , had been acting chief of the agency , which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wild@@ fires .
The agency has been without a Sen@@ ate-@@ confirmed administrator since March , when B@@ rock Long left the post . Long resigned after the Department of Hom@@ eland Security , under which FE@@ MA falls , concluded Long had in@@ appropriately used government vehicles to comm@@ ute between Washington and his home in North Carolina .
A different nominee for the job , Jeff@@ rey B@@ yard , was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month , after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a bar@@ room bra@@ wl .
G@@ ay@@ nor &apos;s nomination to the post was expected . He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job .
Before becoming FE@@ MA &apos;s deputy administrator in 2018 , G@@ ay@@ nor worked in emergency management in Rho@@ de Island and was a Marine , the White House said .
Man set ali@@ ght on door@@ step &apos; in targeted att@@ ack@@ &apos;
A man has been set ali@@ ght on his door@@ step in what police believe is a targeted attack .
The 4@@ 8-@@ year-old was so@@ aked in flam@@ mable liquid , believed to be petrol , before bur@@ sting into flames outside his home in Sk@@ el@@ mer@@ s@@ dale , West Lan@@ cash@@ ire .
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns .
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man &apos;s house at about 1@@ am on Thursday .
Detec@@ tive Chief Inspector Paul@@ ine Sta@@ bles , leading the investigation , said : &quot; This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital .
&quot; We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible .
&quot; While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened , we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don &apos;t believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time .
&quot; Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us .
&quot; Has a loved one come home acting suspici@@ ously , sm@@ elling of smoke or petrol or with un@@ explained injuries ?
&quot; We need to find the people responsible for this dread@@ ful crime . &quot;
Vulnerable D@@ ems air impe@@ achment concerns to Pel@@ os@@ i
During the meeting , several members made clear their stance that Democrats should keep the inquiry focused on the Ukraine matter -- allegations that Trump asked the Ukrainian President to initiate an investigation into a potential 2020 political rival -- and not the other instances of potential wrongdoing detailed in the report from special counsel Robert Mu@@ eller .
Democrats are largely in agreement about the strategy , with Pel@@ os@@ i saying during her press conference on Thursday morning that the whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower complaint is &quot; the focus of the moment . &quot;
By keeping the impe@@ achment inquiry focused , leaders hope to keep the cauc@@ us unified -- with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings . The Ukraine matter is also relatively c@@ lear-@@ cut and easy to explain to the public , lawmakers say . They also argue the probe , spear@@ headed by the intelligence committee , will be able to move faster -- possibly in the next month or two -- with a narrow@@ er scope .
Rep@@ . An@@ gie Cra@@ ig , a vulnerable fresh@@ man Democrat from Minnesota , who said earlier this week that she supported the impe@@ achment inquiry said after the meeting that Pel@@ os@@ i and Democratic leaders mostly listened to the views raised by the lawmakers .
&quot; I &apos;m in a district where I &apos;ve been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where I want to be disciplined , I want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts -- and this process will allow us to do that , &quot; Cra@@ ig said , adding she backed a narrow probe led by the House Intelligence Committee .
Rep@@ . Matt Car@@ tw@@ right , a Democrat from Pennsylvania , told CNN that he wouldn &apos;t -- at this point -- vote for articles of impe@@ achment .
&quot; I would vote no right now because we haven &apos;t seen all the facts , &quot; Car@@ tw@@ right said . &quot; We have to pre@@ sume that people are innocent , don &apos;t we , and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of documentation , if if all that is true . &quot;
Democrats will hear from constituents about their moves toward impe@@ achment soon , with members scheduled to return to their districts for a two-week rec@@ ess at the start of October . It will be the first time a sw@@ ath of members from more conservative districts will receive clear , in-@@ person feedback -- or , in some cases , blow@@ back -- from the people they represent since they joined calls for impe@@ achment proceedings in the wake of the Ukraine allegations earlier this week .
But Rep@@ . Dan Kil@@ de@@ e , a Michigan Democrat , said the timing of the rec@@ ess has its up@@ sides .
&quot; I really can &apos;t think of a better thing to do than to sort of check in with the boss before we move forward , &quot; he told reporters . &quot; It &apos;s actually good timing that we get a chance to go home , catch our breath , get the perspective of people back home , explain what we &apos;re doing , and then come back and move forward accordingly . &quot;
Once lawmakers return , though , movement is likely to be quick .
&quot; I think it &apos;s everybody &apos;s intention here to get this done in 2019 , &quot; said Rep@@ . Jam@@ ie Ras@@ kin , an impe@@ achment advocate and member of the Judiciary Committee .
&quot; The cauc@@ us is unified around the law@@ lessness and corruption pouring forth from the White House , and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impe@@ achment that make sense to the country , &quot; the Maryland Democrat told reporters on Thursday night . &quot; We need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a coherent story to the public . And if we do our job right , it will be a unifying exercise for the whole country . &quot;
Rep@@ . Anthony Brindisi , a fresh@@ man from New York who has resisted calls for an impe@@ achment probe , told CNN that he &apos;s &quot; not yet &quot; there on impe@@ aching Trump .
&quot; While I find many of the statements in the whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower &apos;s report disturbing , there &apos;s a lot more information that &apos;s out there , &quot; Brindisi said . &quot; We have to talk to some of these officials that they have listed in the report here and see where it goes . &quot;
More than half the members of the US House of Representatives have said they support an impe@@ achment inquiry , according to a CNN count . However , that count includes many Democrats who say they support an impe@@ achment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impe@@ ach Trump . Even if the House could pass the vote , it likely would go nowhere in the Republ@@ ic@@ an-@@ controlled Senate , one of many reasons the issue has been politically divi@@ sive in the party .
Still there has been a surge in support -- more than 75 House members in about three days -- of launching such an inquiry as part of the fall@@ out from Trump &apos;s July 25 call with Ukrainian President V@@ olo@@ dy@@ my@@ r Zel@@ en@@ sky where he discussed former Vice President Joe Bi@@ den . There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Bi@@ den .
Trump official says lawyers had Ukraine call transcript moved to secure system
A senior Trump administration official acknowledged Friday that White House lawyers directed moving the transcript of President Trump &apos;s July phone call with Ukrainian President V@@ olo@@ dy@@ my@@ r Zel@@ en@@ sky to a highly secure system .
Other details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known , beyond the allegations contained in the whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower complaint about that call .
The whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower complaint , which was decl@@ assi@@ fied by the Trump administration and released to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee , alleges that White House officials said they were &quot; directed &quot; by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept .
The whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information . The whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower also said that , according to White House officials , it was &quot; not the first time &quot; a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national secur@@ ity-@@ sensitive information . The complaint alleged that the White House tried to &quot; restrict access &quot; to records of the call .
&quot; In the days following the phone call , I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to &quot; lock down &quot; all records of the phone call , especially the official wor@@ d-@@ for-@@ word transcript of the call that was produced - as customary - by the White House Situation Room , &quot; the whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower stated .
The White House released an un@@ classified version of that transcript of the call on Wednesday . The mem@@ o , which does not reflect a &quot; verbatim transcript &quot; but is based on &quot; notes and recol@@ lec@@ tions &quot; of those mem@@ ori@@ alizing the call , shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating the B@@ id@@ ens .
&quot; The other thing , there is a lot of talk about Bi@@ den &apos;s son , that Bi@@ den stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great , &quot; he said . &quot; Bi@@ den went around bra@@ gging that he stopped the prosecution , so if you can look into it ... sounds horrible to me . &quot;
This refers to Joe Bi@@ den , while vice president , urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Vi@@ k@@ tor Sho@@ kin who was investigating the natural gas firm Bur@@ is@@ ma Holdings - where his son , Hunter Bi@@ den , was on the board . Bi@@ den allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention .
But the whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower &apos;s complaint alleges that Trump was sol@@ iciting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign . The whist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower acknowledged in the complaint , though , that the concerns were based on second-@@ hand information .
The White House lawyers &quot; directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top Democrats as a &quot; co@@ ver@@ -up . &quot;
House Speaker Nancy Pel@@ os@@ i , D-@@ Cal@@ if . , who was prompted by Ukraine developments this week to announce a formal impe@@ achment inquiry into the president , called the move a &quot; co@@ ver@@ -up &quot; and said it would be part of the impe@@ achment inquiry .
Meanwhile , Trump lawyer Jay Se@@ k@@ ul@@ ow down@@ played the importance of the record-keeping details .
&quot; A co@@ ver@@ -up ? Think about that for a moment , &quot; Se@@ k@@ ul@@ ow said on &quot; Fox &amp; Friends &quot; Friday . &quot; The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine ? It &apos;s so secret and such a co@@ ver@@ -up , here &apos;s the documents . This is nonsense . &quot;
Ukraine scandal : Pel@@ os@@ i says Bar@@ r &apos; ro@@ gue &apos; ; former U.S. officials back investigation
House Speaker Nancy Pel@@ os@@ i accused U.S. Attorney General William Bar@@ r Friday of going &quot; ro@@ gue &quot; to protect President Donald Trump over his controversial phone call with Ukraine &apos;s leader , which has led to an impe@@ achment inquiry .
The California Democrat &apos;s words follow a release of the complaint Thursday , which was submitted by an unidentified intelligence official to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael At@@ kinson . At@@ kinson turned it over to national intelligence director Joseph M@@ agu@@ ire .
Bar@@ r is mentioned several times in the July 25 phone call , as is Trump attorney Rud@@ ol@@ ph Gi@@ uli@@ ani . The complaint says White House officials were concerned enough that they attempted to &quot; lock down &quot; the record of the call .
&quot; &#91; Bar@@ r has &#93; gone ro@@ gue , &quot; Pel@@ os@@ i told MS@@ NBC Friday . &quot; I think where they &apos;re going is a co@@ ver@@ -up of a co@@ ver@@ -up . I think it &apos;s sad , to have a Justice Department go so ro@@ gue . Well , they have been for a while . And now it just makes matters worse . &quot;
Pel@@ os@@ i announced an official impe@@ achment investigation this week after Trump acknowledged he &apos;d withheld military aid to Ukraine . The aid was ultimately granted , but House Democrats want to know whether there was any connection to the aid and Trump &apos;s asking Zel@@ en@@ sky to investigate Hunter Bi@@ den , who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for five years .
Also Friday , nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impe@@ achment investigation . The coalition said Trump &apos;s actions constitute a &quot; profound national security concern . &quot;
&quot; We applaud those members of Congress , including Speaker Pel@@ os@@ i , who have started us down that necessary path , &quot; the letter states . &quot; President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process . That would constitute an un@@ consci@@ onable abuse of power .
&quot; It would also represent an effort to subordinate America &apos;s national interests -- and those of our closest allies and partners -- to the president &apos;s personal political interest . &quot;
Trump has denied there was any impro@@ pri@@ ety with the phone call . Friday , he denounced the complainant and again said the call with Zel@@ en@@ sky was a &quot; perfect conversation &quot;
&quot; S@@ ounding more and more like the so-called whist@@ le-@@ bl@@ ower isn &apos;t a whist@@ le-@@ bl@@ ower at all , &quot; he t@@ wee@@ ted . &quot; In addition , all second-@@ hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have been somebody else , a le@@ aker or spy , feeding it to him or her ? A partisan operative ? &quot;
Vice President Mike P@@ ence also had interactions with Ukrainian leaders , the whist@@ le-@@ bl@@ ower complaint shows , and he met with Zel@@ en@@ sky in Poland earlier this month . He said neither Joe Bi@@ den or Hunter Bi@@ den were discussed .
Death of Chinese activist in police custody promp@@ ts calls for investigation into torture
Human rights advocates are calling for an investigation into the death of a Chinese activist , arrested after holding up a plac@@ ard calling for Chinese leader Xi Jin@@ ping to step down .
Wang M@@ ei@@ yu , 38 , was detained in July after he stood outside the Hunan provincial police department holding a sign that called on Xi and Chinese premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang to resign and implement universal suffrage in China . He was later charged with &quot; picking quar@@ rels and provo@@ king trouble , &quot; a vague offence often given to dissi@@ dents .
According to Wang &apos;s mother and lawyer , he died on Monday . Wang &apos;s wife Cao Shu@@ xia received a call from police notifying her that her husband had died at a military hospital in the city of H@@ eng@@ yang where he had been held . The police officer on the phone did not offer any explanation of the cause of death .
According to Min@@ sh@@ eng Gu@@ anch@@ a , a Chinese human rights group , Cao was later able to see Wang &apos;s body and saw he was bleeding from his eyes , mouth , ears and nose and there were bru@@ ises on his face .
&quot; The Chinese government must investigate allegations of torture and the death in detention of human rights activist Wang M@@ ei@@ yu and hold the perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial killing crimin@@ ally accountable , &quot; the Chinese Human Rights Defenders ( CH@@ RD ) said in a statement .
According to Radio Free Asia , Cao said police pres@@ sured her to accept their statement that Wang &apos;s death had been an accident but she refused . An officer at the H@@ eng@@ yang police station said he could not comment on the case . Wang &apos;s mother told the Guardian the family has been offered compensation of more than 2 million yuan ( about $ 2@@ 20,000 ) .
&quot; Giving compensation without an investigation or criminal accountability for the perpetrator is not true redress nor will it effectively prevent torture , &quot; said Fran@@ ces Eve , deputy director of research at CH@@ RD .
&quot; Especially when a family has effectively been held hostage and thus likely coer@@ ced into giving up claims for investigation for the compensation . &quot;
Wang &apos;s death follows after those of other activists including grassroots lawyer J@@ i S@@ iz@@ un , who died in police custody in July , U@@ igh@@ ur scholar Muhammad Sali@@ h Haj@@ im who died last year . Nobel lau@@ reate winner Liu Xia@@ ob@@ o who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11-@@ year-@@ prison sentence and activist Cao Sh@@ un@@ li died in 2014 , detained after attempting to attend a UN session on human rights in China .
Since Monday , Wang &apos;s family has been placed under house arrest , according to CH@@ RD . He has two young children . Others connected to his case have also come under pressure . Late on Wednesday , six armed police detained X@@ ie Yang , a rights lawyer , and Chen Yan@@ hui , an activist , who had met at a hotel to discuss Wang &apos;s case . They were released on Thursday .
Wang , who began his work as an activist when his home was forcibly demolished , has been detained and claimed to have suffered torture before .
In 2018 after he held up the plac@@ ard calling for Xi &apos;s resignation , he wrote online of how police stor@@ med into his home , ordering him to write a confession letter and a statement promising he would stop .
&quot; These idi@@ ots . They can &apos;t understand that even after these years of persecution , including being deprived of water for three days or suffering two hours of electrical need@@ les that caused me to vom@@ it blood , I won &apos;t surrender . &quot;

Hong Kong police say student arrests at protests increase
Hong Kong police said Friday that students accounted for 29 % of nearly 1,600 people detained in anti-@@ democracy protests since June and urged young people to take the &quot; straight and narrow path &quot; as more major r@@ allies are planned this weekend .
Police public relations chief T@@ se Ch@@ un-@@ ch@@ ung said 207 high school and university students were detained this month alone despite the resumption of classes after the summer holiday , compared to 257 over the Jun@@ e-@@ August period .
He said there was a rise in teenagers participating in violent crimes , with some already charged in court . This included a 16-@@ year-old charged recently with ar@@ son , which carries possible a life imprisonment upon conviction , a 13-@@ year-old girl charged with des@@ ec@@ rating Chinese flags and others with attacking police officers and carrying dangerous weapons .
&quot; It is an alarming trend to us , &quot; he said at a news conference . &quot; It is worrying to see these youths breaking the law and possibly having criminal records at such a young and tender age . We appeal to all young@@ sters to re@@ think their actions and hope the education sector and parents will help our young people to walk the straight and narrow path . &quot;
Young people have largely led the protests that started in June over an extradition bill that the government has now agreed to withdraw . But the movement has since drawn wider participation as it snow@@ b@@ alled into a wider anti-@@ China campaign against what protesters say is Beijing &apos;s cre@@ eping intrusion into Hong Kong &apos;s autonomy promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 .
Prote@@ sters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city &apos;s leaders and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality against protesters .
Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest at a downtown square Friday night against alleged abuse of power by police , w@@ aving anti-@@ police ban@@ ners and chan@@ ting pro-@@ democracy slo@@ gans . The government has said complaints against police will be examined by a police watch@@ dog agency that critics say is tooth@@ less and has no real investigative powers .
Police have approved a major rally in downtown Hong Kong on Saturday organized by the Civil Human Rights Front to mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the U@@ mb@@ rella Revolution , when protesters occupied key thorou@@ gh@@ fares in the city for 79 days in 2014 to demand universal suffrage . That movement ended without any government concession .
Prote@@ sters are also organizing &quot; anti-@@ tot@@ al@@ it@@ arianism &quot; r@@ allies in Hong Kong and many cities worldwide on Sunday against what they denounced as China &apos;s tyran@@ ny .
T@@ se appealed to protesters to stop hij@@ acking peaceful protests , like what happened in previous r@@ allies when some lob@@ bed gasoline bombs , set off street fires and vand@@ alized public utilities . Police have responded with tear gas , water cann@@ ons , and other measures , prompting complaints from protesters that they are using excessive force .
The Civil Human Rights Front is also planning another big march on Oc@@ t. 1 , spar@@ king fears of a bloody show@@ down that could embarra@@ ss China &apos;s ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70@@ th year in power with grand festi@@ vities in Beijing . The Hong Kong government has scaled down National Day celebrations by calling off an annual fire@@ work display and moving a reception in@@ doors .
Ne@@ stle tigh@@ tens controls on coffee beans after we@@ ed@@ killer scare
The world &apos;s largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found gly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans .
G@@ ly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate is the key ingredient in Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s we@@ ed@@ killer , R@@ oun@@ du@@ p . In the United States , ju@@ ries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to gly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate . Bay@@ er , which owns Mon@@ san@@ to , says the her@@ b@@ icide is safe when used properly , as does the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Ne@@ um@@ an@@ n Ka@@ ffee G@@ rup@@ pe ( N@@ K@@ G ) , one of the world &apos;s largest traders , said gly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys . Ne@@ stle buys some of its coffee beans from N@@ K@@ G . It was too early to say what consequences Ne@@ stle &apos;s tighter controls would have on N@@ K@@ G , a spokesperson said .
Ne@@ stle &apos;s ( N@@ SR@@ G@@ F ) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains , a spokesperson said . &quot; This is not a new process , we are just reinforcing controls , &quot; the spokesperson told CNN Business . Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin .
Ne@@ stle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil , since these countries are among the world &apos;s biggest coffee producers .
&quot; Our agr@@ onom@@ ists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices , including the appropriate use of her@@ bic@@ ides and adoption of other wee@@ ding methods , &quot; the Swiss company said .
Bran@@ ds such as N@@ es@@ caf@@ e and N@@ es@@ pres@@ so make up a siz@@ able ch@@ unk of Ne@@ stle &apos;s pow@@ dered and liquid beverages business , which generated sales of 2@@ 1.6 billion Swiss francs ( $ 2@@ 1.7 billion ) in 2018 . Ne@@ stle last year agreed a deal to sell Star@@ bucks &apos; packaged co@@ ffe@@ es and te@@ as around the world .
Does gly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate cause cancer ?
G@@ ly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate is used on more than 100 food crops , according to the EPA . Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cere@@ als contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children .
Still , the EPA says gly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate is not a carcino@@ gen and that it poses no public health risks . Ecological risks include damage to pol@@ lin@@ ators and the problem of weed resistance , the EPA said in a statement in April .
But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Mon@@ san@@ to alleging that exposure to R@@ oun@@ du@@ p caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer .
Earlier this year , a jury ordered Bay@@ er to pay a California couple $ 2 billion in damages after they claimed that R@@ oun@@ du@@ p , used on their property for more than three decades , had given them both Non-@@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin lymph@@ oma within four years of one other . Bay@@ er is cont@@ esting the verdict .
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization &apos;s International Agency for Research on Cancer found that gly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate was &quot; probably carcino@@ genic to humans , &quot; based on &quot; limited &quot; evidence of cancer in humans and &quot; sufficient &quot; evidence of cancer in experimental animals . However , a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that gly@@ ph@@ os@@ ate is unlikely to pose a carcino@@ genic risk to humans from exposure through diet .
Man guilty of killing 6 members of his extended family in Texas
A Utah man was convicted Thursday of killing six members of his extended family in Texas and faces the possibility of a death sentence .
A Harris County jury found Ronald Has@@ k@@ ell , 39 , guilty in the July 2014 killings of six members of the Stay family : parents Stephen Stay and K@@ atie Stay , and children Br@@ yan , 13 , Emily , 9 , Re@@ bec@@ ca , 7 and Z@@ ach , 4 .
&quot; We are grateful for the jur@@ ors &apos; rap@@ t attention over the last many weeks to every piece of evidence in the case , &quot; Harris County District Attorney Kim O@@ gg said in a statement . &quot; There was never a reasonable doubt that Has@@ k@@ ell meticul@@ ously planned and carried out the slaughter of the Stay family . &quot;
Police have said that Has@@ k@@ ell traveled from California to the Houston suburb of Spring and am@@ bus@@ hed his ex-@@ wife &apos;s sister , her husband and their five children in their home .
The Sta@@ ys and four of their children were fat@@ ally shot in the back of their heads , and a fifth child , who was 15 at the time , survived . That teen , C@@ assi@@ dy , was gra@@ zed in the head by a bullet and played dead .
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the capital murder case , but jur@@ ors will decide whether Has@@ k@@ ell should receive a death sentence or life in prison .
At trial , the defense argued that Has@@ k@@ ell was insane and heard voices that led him to kill the six people , NBC affiliate K@@ PRC of Houston reported . After the verdict was read Thursday , he hung his head .
&quot; I think he took it as best as you could expect , &quot; said Dou@@ g Dur@@ ham , one of Has@@ k@@ ell &apos;s defense attorneys , according to the station . &quot; He was aware that this was a strong possibility . &quot;
The sentencing phase begins Monday . Has@@ k@@ ell defense attorney Neil Davis III said his team will work &quot; to save his life . That &apos;s our job , &quot; according to K@@ PRC .
The sentencing phase is expected to last around 2 ½ weeks , the station reported .
C@@ assi@@ dy testified at the trial and was surrounded by family members . She appeared to be pra@@ ying before the guilty verdict was read Thursday , according to K@@ PRC .
At a 2014 memorial for her family , C@@ assi@@ dy thanked the community for its support and said that she was comfor@@ ted knowing her parents , two brothers and two sisters are &quot; in a much better place , and that I &apos;ll be able to see them again one day . &quot;
Has@@ k@@ ell was disguised as a F@@ ed@@ Ex delivery driver when he went to the Stay home , apparently looking for his ex-@@ wife , who is K@@ atie Stay &apos;s sister .
He forced his way inside and tied up C@@ assi@@ dy , officials said . When the rest of her family returned minutes later , Has@@ k@@ ell tied them up and demanded to know the whereabouts of his ex-@@ wife . They said they didn &apos;t know , and they were each shot in the back of the head .
C@@ assi@@ dy , who was wounded , played dead until Has@@ k@@ ell left , and was able to identify him to police . She told officials he was planning to drive to her grandparents &apos; home and kill them . But police tracked down Has@@ k@@ ell , and he was arrested after a 20-@@ minute police chase and a three-@@ hour stan@@ do@@ ff .
US deaths could result in Scottish ban on vap@@ ing and e-@@ cigarette ads
A B@@ AN on advertising for e-@@ cigarettes and vap@@ ing products , is being considered by ministers .
The First Minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in &quot; the coming months . &quot;
Nic@@ ola St@@ ur@@ geon says that if evidence supports further moves over the sale of such products her Government would &quot; not hesitate &quot; to act .
It comes as it emerged a vap@@ ing-related illness had claimed two more lives , bringing the total number of fatalities to 11 .
V@@ aping - which involves inhal@@ ing a mix typically made of nic@@ o@@ tine , water , solven@@ ts and flav@@ ours - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit , but its safety is still not entirely known .
But in the US , more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking e-@@ cigarettes . Officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone .
The first deaths in Florida and Georgia were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday . Currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness , with lives lost in eight states .
While most patients have reported a history of using products containing TH@@ C , the psycho@@ active compound in cannabis , the patient who died in Georgia on Wednesday reported only &quot; heavy nic@@ o@@ tine vap@@ ing . &quot;
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( C@@ DC ) has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mystery illness , and has warned citizens against smoking e-@@ cigarette products until more is known , particularly if modified or bought &quot; off the street . &quot;
The First Minister has confirmed the Scottish Government was monit@@ origin developments in the US and elsewhere &quot; closely , &quot; following the loss of life that has been attributed to vap@@ ing .
She pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vap@@ ing being reported in Europe .
&quot; Our approach has been a precautionary one , which is why in Scotland we have already taken the stric@@ test regulatory approach in Europe to vap@@ our products , &quot; she said .
&quot; The European tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of e-@@ cigarettes and ensures that e-@@ liquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful .
&quot; The directive also limits the concentration of nic@@ o@@ tine in e-@@ liquids .
&quot; In Scotland , we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations .
&quot; In the coming months , we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vap@@ our products . &quot;
She added : &quot; It is important to stress , and for all of us to remember , that those devices are relatively new and , therefore , their impact continues to be studied . We do not yet fully understand what that impact is , which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious .
&quot; That is perhaps a reason why e-@@ cigarette use remains relatively low in Scotland .
&quot; We remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm .
&quot; While we already have among the stric@@ test regimes on those products , if the evidence shows that further action is needed ... we will not hesitate to take it . &quot;
Cambodian court charges ex@@ iled politicians with rebellion
A Cambodian court has charged seven top opposition politicians with plot@@ ting armed rebellion for planning to return from self-@@ imposed exile to seek a change in government through mass peaceful protests .
The Phnom Penh Municipal Court also warned that anyone who supported the plans of the Cambodia National Rescue Party to ou@@ st the government would also be ris@@ king a long prison term .
The returning party chiefs could be sent to prison for 15 to 30 years if found guilty , and their supporters could be sentenced to five to 10 years . Even attending a rally or expressing support online could be considered plot@@ ting to top@@ ple the government , Justice Ministry spokesman Ch@@ in Mal@@ in was quoted as saying .
The court &apos;s charges on Thursday are the latest sal@@ vo in a political battle that has heated up since opposition leader Sam Rain@@ sy announced plans to return from more than three years of exile on Nov@@ . 9 to seek a &quot; restoration of democracy . &quot;
Nov@@ . 9 is Cambodia &apos;s independence day , celebrating when it obtained its freedom from France in 1953 .
&quot; My calls to the people and the armed forces of # Cambodia to rise up against the regime will continue until the regime has restored to the opposition its right to participate in the country &apos;s political life including genuine elections , &quot; Sam Rain@@ sy said on Twitter earlier this week .
His opposition party was dissolved by the courts ahead of last year &apos;s general election , ensuring that an increasingly authoritarian Prime Minister Hu@@ n Sen continued his four decades in power .
The party had been expected to mount a strong challenge in the July 2018 election , and its dissolution was widely seen as being politically motivated , with Hu@@ n Sen &apos;s ruling Cambodian People &apos;s Party fearful that it could lose power in the polls .
Hu@@ n Sen &apos;s government seems un@@ ner@@ ved by the planned return of opposition politicians , though the effort appears to be a qui@@ x@@ otic one , with Sam Rain@@ sy calling on Cambodian workers in Thailand to accompany him home in massive numbers .
Officials have vowed to arrest Sam Rain@@ sy on his arrival , but there is speculation that Cambodia may simply bar him from entry , which could even keep him from boarding a plane to the country if airlines are officially informed of such a ban . Neigh@@ boring countries are also unlikely to allow him to enter from their territory .
However , the government has stepped up arrests of his supporters and there are reports of recent physical attacks on opposition organizers .
Sam Rain@@ sy went into exile in late 2015 to avoid a two-year prison sentence on charges of criminal defamation . Other legal cases have since been lodged against him by the government .
Other top party members fled into exile during a late 2017 crack@@ down on all opposition to Hu@@ n Sen , which included the arrest of the party &apos;s co-@@ founder , K@@ em So@@ k@@ ha . He was charged with treason , based on his links to a U.S. pro-@@ democracy organization , and is under strict house arrest .
This year &apos;s Turner Pri@@ z@@ e-@@ short@@ listed pieces will be on display in Mar@@ gate from tomorrow , with Brexit on the agenda .
Colombian artist Oscar Mur@@ illo &apos;s work &quot; surge ( social cat@@ ar@@ acts ) &quot; depicts people staring out to the North Sea , but with their view of the water and the European continent on the other side of it obs@@ cured by a dark canvas , with only a sli@@ ver of what lies beyond revealed through a s@@ lash in the canvas .
The work is one of four short@@ listed entries to the prestigious and often contentious annual art prize , founded in 1984 and given to an artist residing in Britain or Bri@@ ti@@ sh@@ -@@ born but living elsewhere .
Cur@@ ator Fi@@ ona Par@@ ry explains that Mur@@ illo &apos;s work focuses on the current political and socio-economic situation in the UK . The group of pap@@ i@@ er-@@ m@@ â@@ ch@@ é figures represent a glob@@ alised workforce , while the black cloth represents the &quot; darkness of the contemporary moment in the UK and globally . &quot;
She added : &quot; I think it &apos;s a broader idea of blocking the view , the outw@@ ard-@@ looking view , to anywhere really . And that gesture of blocking the light . But I guess there is still this sort of glim@@ mer of hope , there is a s@@ lash in the canvas , and you can just see the sea on the horizon . &quot;
Helen Cam@@ mock &apos;s video piece A Long Note , meanwhile , examines the overlooked role of women in the civil rights movement in Der@@ ry / Lon@@ don@@ der@@ ry , Northern Ireland that began in 1968 . The work also connects to broader global class , race and gender struggles during the late 1960s .
All works will be exhibited at Mar@@ gate &apos;s Turner Contemporary gallery , from 28 September to 12 January 2020 , and the winner of the Turner Prize 2019 will be announced at a ceremony on 3 December .

Man ple@@ ads guilty in kid@@ nap , torture plot of plastic surgeon
A Florida man has pleaded guilty to kidnapping a plastic surgeon who was tortured with a blow@@ torch in an extortion attempt .
The Sun Sen@@ tin@@ el reports 3@@ 4-@@ year-old J@@ ustin B@@ oc@@ cio pleaded guilty Thursday to kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the January attack on the surgeon , who hasn &apos;t been publicly identified .
B@@ oc@@ cio &apos;s attorney , Kenne@@ th Lan@@ ge , said his client was convinced to take part in the scheme by co-@@ defendant , Ser@@ ge N@@ k@@ or@@ ina , who &apos;s being extradited from T@@ ener@@ i@@ fe , Spain .
Court documents say the surgeon was leaving a Wal@@ mar@@ t store when he was confronted by an armed man and sho@@ ved into a van . They say he was tortured for hours before being returned to his car while unconscious . Surveillance video supports the chain of events .

US sends troops , air defense systems to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran attacks
The U.S. is sending a Patri@@ ot missile battery , four groun@@ d-based radar systems , and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran &apos;s increasingly aggressive behavior , officials announced Thursday .
A TH@@ A@@ AD missile defense system and two additional Patri@@ ot missile batteries are prepared to go if needed , the Pent@@ agon said .
&quot; Other countries have called out Iranian mis@@ ad@@ ventures in the region , and we look for them to contribute assets in an international effort to reinforce Saudi Arabia &apos;s defense , &quot; Pent@@ agon spokesman Jonathan Ho@@ ff@@ man said .
Last week , Defense Secretary Mark Es@@ per said more troops would deploy to the Middle East as a &quot; defensive &quot; measure to help protect against attacks from Iran .
Es@@ per said the deployment was a first step toward addressing Iran &apos;s increasingly violent acts in the region -- including this month &apos;s dr@@ one attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities -- and he called on other nations to step up and condemn the attacks .
Iran@@ -@@ backed Hou@@ th@@ i rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the S@@ ept . 14 attack on the world &apos;s largest oil processing plant and a major oil field , but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran directly . Iran has denied involvement in the attack .
&quot; It is clear &#91; ... &#93; that the weapons used were Iran@@ ian-@@ produced and were not launched from Yemen , &quot; Es@@ per said Friday , noting that all signs indicate &quot; Iran was responsible for the attack . &quot;
The purpose of deploying troops and resources is to &quot; send a clear message that the United States supports our partners &quot; and provide a &quot; free flow of resources , &quot; Es@@ per said .
The U.S. calls on other countries to also &quot; stand up and condemn the attacks , &quot; as well as contribute capabilities , the secretary said .
Me@@ gh@@ an Mar@@ kle was &apos; never asked &apos; about Su@@ its cam@@ eo
The creator of Su@@ its , Aaron Kor@@ sh , has said he &quot; never asked &quot; Britain &apos;s Du@@ chess of Sus@@ sex , Me@@ gh@@ an Mar@@ kle , to re@@ prise her role as Rachel Z@@ ane for a cam@@ eo in the show &apos;s la@@ st-@@ ever episode .
In an interview with De@@ ad@@ line@@ .com following the air@@ ing of Su@@ its &apos; fin@@ ale in the US , Kor@@ sh was asked if there was &quot; any possibility &quot; of the former actress being asked &quot; to do even a small cam@@ eo . &quot;
&quot; Now that we already did it , I will tell you , &quot; Kor@@ sh replied .
&quot; I thought about asking , and I thought about even using audio footage - that we have to come up with something - and in the end I didn &apos;t ask , and I just thought , &apos; I &apos;m going to respect her new life and not put her in the position of having to ask &apos; .
&quot; We decided not to put her in that position so I never asked . &quot;
The Du@@ chess of Sus@@ sex appeared in archive Su@@ its footage during the fin@@ ale &apos;s mon@@ tage .
She starred as Rachel Z@@ ane in the New Yor@@ k-@@ set legal drama from 2011 until her final episode aired last year .
In the final series , Rachel &apos;s on@@ screen husband Mike Ross , played by Patrick J Adams , paid a visit from Seattle and was asked how Rachel was getting on .
&quot; If I told you how good , you probably wouldn &apos;t believe me , &quot; he replied .

Germany reports landmark case of West Nile virus
Authorities are reporting the first known human case of West Nile virus transmitted by mosqu@@ it@@ oes in Germany , a development apparently ha@@ st@@ ened by climate change .
The national disease control and tropical medicine centers said Friday the person developed en@@ cep@@ h@@ ali@@ tis but recovered after hospital treatment .
The virus originated in Africa but has been spread north@@ ward by migratory birds and mosqu@@ it@@ oes . There have been several outbreaks in southern and central Europe in recent years . It is found in much of the U.@@ S .
Jon@@ as Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ Chan@@ a@@ sit of Germany &apos;s Bern@@ hard No@@ cht Institute tropical medicine center said that &quot; the unusually warm sum@@ mers of the last two years , triggered by climate change , apparently have contributed to W@@ N@@ V establishing itself north of the Al@@ ps . &quot;

Men undergoing surgery for pro@@ state cancer fare as well without radi@@ otherapy
Men undergoing surgery for pro@@ state cancer fare just as well without radi@@ otherapy , a major study has found .
The findings , from the the largest ever trial examining those having surgery for the disease , could spare thousands from gru@@ elling treatment which can have di@@ stressing side-@@ effects .
The Royal Mar@@ s@@ den study involved 1,400 men being treated for pro@@ state cancer .
Half were given immediate radi@@ otherapy , which until now has been standard treatment to prevent the return of disease . The rest were monitored and only given radi@@ otherapy if there were signs that disease had returned .
Scientists found that five years later , there was almost no difference in disease recurrence between the two groups , with those who did not have treatment f@@ aring slightly better .
Progres@@ sion free survival was 85 per cent in the radi@@ otherapy group and 88 per cent in the standard care group .
There was a difference of around 1 per cent between the groups , after data was adjusted to take account of other factors .
The study , funded by Cancer Research UK , found those who had radi@@ otherapy were twice as likely to suffer a worsening of ur@@ inary in@@ contin@@ ence , one of the main side effects of pro@@ state cancer treatment .
One year after surgery 5.3 per cent of patients receiving radi@@ otherapy suffered a deterioration , compared to 2.7 per cent who had standard care .
Se@@ th Dun@@ lap Louisiana : WW@@ L Radio host threatening to sue over anti-@@ gay t@@ we@@ et sent the t@@ we@@ et himself , station claims , similar to Jus@@ sie Sm@@ ol@@ lett case
A radio host in New Orleans said he received an anti-@@ gay sl@@ ur , sent to him from the radio station &apos;s Twitter account . On Wednesday , WW@@ L host Se@@ th Dun@@ lap , who is openly gay , said he planned to sue the station &apos;s parent company after working for years in a hom@@ ophob@@ ic and hostile workplace . In a strange turn of events Thursday , the New Orleans Police Department said the hom@@ ophob@@ ic t@@ we@@ et sent to Dun@@ lap came from none other than Dun@@ lap &apos;s phone .
The t@@ we@@ et in question was sent earlier this month and the day it was sent , Dun@@ lap hosted his show as usual . But the next day , he announced a leave of absence , CBS affiliate WW@@ L-@@ TV reports .
In a statement , Dun@@ lap said 14 people had access WW@@ L &apos;s Twitter account . He claimed he was not one of the people with access to the account .
However , he decided to take a poly@@ graph test to dis@@ pel any speculation that he was the one who sent the t@@ we@@ et to himself , his lawyer Meg@@ an Ki@@ ef@@ er , said . A lawsuit has not yet been filed on Dun@@ lap &apos;s behalf , but he said in his statement that one would be coming , according to WW@@ L-@@ TV .
WW@@ L Radio , which is a CBS News Radio affiliate but is owned by Enter@@ com , said in a statement it had investigated the t@@ we@@ et and decided to refer the matter to law enforcement officials . &quot; WW@@ L has completed its investigation into the highly offensive , unauthorized t@@ we@@ et sent from WW@@ L &apos;s Twitter account on September 10 , which directed a hom@@ ophob@@ ic sl@@ ur at Se@@ th Dun@@ lap , &quot; said WW@@ L Radio in a statement .
&quot; We determined that the most appropriate next step is to involve law enforcement . At this point , the investigation is in the hands of law enforcement and it is not appropriate for us to comment any further on the substance of our findings , &quot; the statement continue .
The New Orleans Police Department opened their investigation into the t@@ we@@ et and in a police report Thursday revealed a twist in the story : The hom@@ ophob@@ ic sl@@ ur was allegedly sent from Dun@@ lap &apos;s personal cell@@ phone .
Radio host Se@@ th Dun@@ lap claimed he worked in a hom@@ ophob@@ ic and hostile workplace for years . After allegedly receiving a t@@ we@@ et with an anti-@@ gay sl@@ ur from the radio station &apos;s Twitter , he threatened to sue .
WW@@ L accused Dun@@ lap of threatening the station for money , NO@@ LA@@ .com reports . WW@@ L alleged the 35-@@ year-old radio host said he would &quot; scor@@ ch the earth &quot; over the t@@ we@@ et and then demanded over $ 1.8 million in compensation . According to a police report obtained by NO@@ LA@@ .com , WW@@ L said Dun@@ lap made this threat when he was facing personal financial issues .
The allegations were made by WW@@ L &apos;s senior vice president Kevin C@@ assi@@ dy and attorneys for the parent company , Enter@@ com . The police department is still working to corrobor@@ ate the allegations , but have classified the case as possible extortion . In the state of Louisiana , extortion is defined as &quot; the communication of threats to another with the intention ( to ) obtain anything of value . &quot;

Mac Miller death : Third man charged with drug offences
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with the over@@ dose death of rap@@ per Mac Miller .
Steven Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxy@@ co@@ done pills lac@@ ed with f@@ ent@@ any@@ l that Miller possessed before he died of an accidental over@@ dose last year of cocaine , alcohol and the powerful opio@@ id .
Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man , Cameron Pet@@ ti@@ t , sold to Miller .
Ryan Re@@ av@@ is , 36 , who was arrested in Lake Hav@@ as@@ u City , Arizona , this week is accused of serving as Walter &apos;s &quot; runner , &quot; who delivered the pills to Pet@@ ti@@ t .
Walter , who is on supervised release over a 2005 drug case , remains in custody .
A Pittsburgh native whose real name was Mal@@ col@@ m James M@@ yers Mc@@ Cor@@ m@@ ick , Miller &apos;s lyrics included frank discussion of his depression and drug use , earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hi@@ p-@@ hop .
He was also in a two-year relationship with Ari@@ ana Grande that ended earlier in 2018 . After his death she posted an affec@@ tion@@ ate video of him on her In@@ stag@@ ram page and released a song , Thank U Next , that lov@@ ingly mentioned him .
Miller was one of several musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to a national wave of opio@@ id abuse and over@@ doses .
Prince died in 2016 when he took counterfeit pills lac@@ ed with f@@ ent@@ any@@ l that looked like a generic version of the pain@@ killer Vic@@ od@@ in .
Matthew Roberts , guit@@ arist for the band 3 Do@@ ors Down , also died of an over@@ dose in 2016 , and had f@@ ent@@ any@@ l and hydro@@ co@@ done in his system .
Woman ST@@ R@@ IPS TO NO@@ TH@@ ING in Wal@@ mar@@ t to prove she didn &apos;t steal
A woman accused of sho@@ pli@@ fting at a Wal@@ mar@@ t in Mexico City took drastic measures to prove her innocence , stri@@ pping stark naked in the middle of the supermarket as a stun@@ ned security guard looked on .
In a video of the incident , filmed at the Te@@ pe@@ y@@ ac Wal@@ mar@@ t branch in Mexico City earlier this week , a security guard can be seen approaching a woman apparently suspected of theft as she ne@@ ared the store &apos;s exit . Her reaction once she was stopped , however , left the watch@@ man speech@@ less .
The woman first pe@@ els off her skirt and begins to proceed toward the exit , but , perhaps un@@ satisfied her guilt was yet as@@ su@@ aged , soon turned around to remove her shirt as well . Now fully n@@ ude , she stor@@ med off , clothes in hand .
The birth@@ day-@@ suited shop@@ per &apos;s identity remains unknown , though she appears to have been allowed to leave the premises after the impro@@ mp@@ tu pe@@ ep show .
Similar biz@@ arre sights are nothing new for Wal@@ mar@@ t . In July , security cameras caught a Pennsylvania woman reli@@ eving herself into a bin of potatoes at a Wal@@ mar@@ t in the town of West Mi@@ ff@@ lin . The woman , who is vi@@ sibly intox@@ icated in the footage , was charged with open le@@ w@@ dness , public drun@@ ken@@ ness , criminal mis@@ chief and dis@@ orderly conduct for the deed , and became a viral sensation to boot .
In another case of compelled supermarket n@@ ud@@ ity this week , a British man , Steve Whit@@ e@@ hur@@ st , was forced to expose himself to security guards after they spotted a mysterious &quot; bul@@ ge &quot; in his pants . He hadn &apos;t stolen anything .
&quot; I can &apos;t help the way I &apos;m made , &quot; Whit@@ e@@ hur@@ st told the Sun .
